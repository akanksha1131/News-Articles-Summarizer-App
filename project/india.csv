'Institutional Murder' Rahul Blames BJP Govt for “Shielding Criminals” in Maha Doctor’s Suicide case

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday launched a sharp attack on the Maharashtra government, claiming that law and order in the state has “collapsed” following the alleged rape and suicide of a woman doctor in Satara. The grand old party also accused the state’s home department of being “bankrupt.”Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar said, “The Home Department of Maharashtra is bankrupt. The law and order situation has completely collapsed... Ordinary people don't even have the courage to go to the police station... The police have become vagrants, resorting to hooliganism...”Deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde, meanwhile, condemned the incident and assured that the accused would face strict action. “The accused have been arrested. The incident is condemnable and unfortunate. In this case, none of the accused will be let go, there will be very harsh punishment, and the whole matter will go to the fast-track court,” Shinde said.Maharashtra minister Pankaja Gopinath Munde also met the victim’s family in Phaltan and expressed support and solidarity, assuring them of justice.Earlier, Satara Police arrested two individuals -- Police Sub-Inspector Gopal Badne and Prashant Bankar — in connection with the case.The two have been booked under charges of rape and abetment to suicide. PSI Badne, who was named in the suicide note, has been suspended, officials confirmed.Authorities said the woman doctor died by suicide on Friday, leaving behind a message written on her hand that mentioned a police officer and two others.The victim’s cousin alleged that she had been facing sustained political and police pressure related to her professional duties. “There was a lot of police and political pressure on her to make wrong mortem reports. She tried to complain about it. My sister should get justice,” the cousin told ANI.“She was under a lot of political and police pressure for the last year. Medical staff at the hospital are also involved. Everyone forced her to make wrong postmortem reports and forge fitness certificates. She was being forced to perform more and more postmortems despite other officers being present at the hospital,” the cousin added.The family suspects that another suicide note may exist, suggesting that the doctor had been documenting her complaints and distress in writing. Another relative demanded exemplary punishment, saying, “The accused should get the strictest of punishment.”The Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) has condemned the death of doctor and called for an immediate and transparent investigation into the case.","Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar said, “The Home Department of Maharashtra is bankrupt.

MUMBAI: The Dindoshi Special Pocso Court acquitted a 35-year-old man accused of repeatedly raping his minor daughter, citing lack of evidence and contradictions in the prosecution's case.Criticising the police for a shoddy investigation, the court said that the investigating officer failed to record a supplementary statement of the victim after receiving the medical papers and did not seize the clothes of the victim and accused for forensic analysis.Special Judge Smt Ashwini D Lokhande, while acquitting the father, said that he was in judicial custody since his arrest in 2019 when the case was registered by Kandivli police station.According to the public prosecutor, Geeta Malankar, the alleged incidents took place between 2020 and 2022, when the victim was aged between 8 and 10 years.However, the Special Pocso Court observed that the victim's testimony did not support the allegation of sexual assault.In her deposition, the girl stated that her father beat her and her mother after an argument over mobile phone use but did not mention any act of sexual assault.The judge noted that she retracted from her earlier statements to the police and before the magistrate and did not provide any incriminating evidence against the accused.The victim's mother, who was also examined as a witness, denied the allegation that her husband committed any sexual act with their daughter.She claimed the police did not read the contents of the complaint to her before she signed it.The court also noted that there were frequent quarrels between the couple, and the mother often stayed at her maternal home, indicating family discord.The medical evidence, too, did not support the prosecution. The doctor who examined the child, did not find any internal or external injuries on the victim's private parts and gave no opinion regarding sexual assault in her report.""The evidence of the prosecution witnesses is not sufficient to prove the charges. There is no iota of evidence to draw any adverse inference against the accused,"" the court observed. Advocate Suvarna Avhad Vast for the accused said that his client was falsely implicated in the case.","The Dindoshi Special Pocso Court acquitted a 35-year-old man accused of repeatedly raping his minor daughter.

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case

My mother treated Phaltan doctor like own daughter: Sister of arrested techie





PUNE: The Satara police arrested a techie and a police sub-inspector on Saturday in connection with the alleged rape and abetment of suicide of a 28-year-old doctor employed at the Phaltan subdistrict hospital.While the techie was arrested early in the morning, the police sub-inspector surrendered before the Phaltan rural police late in the night, a senior police officer said.“A court remanded the techie in four-day police custody till Oct 28,” said Satara superintendent of police Tushar Doshi.The brother and sister of the techie, speaking to TOI, denied the claim that he was arrested from a farmhouse in Pune. “My brother was arrested from our house in Phaltan. We had called him and told him to surrender. His social media records and call details have been given to the police. My brother never called the doctor. Instead, it was the doctor who used to call him repeatedly and harass him,” said the brother of the accused.Doctors’ associations in the state demanded transfer of the case to the state CID/ SIT to ensure an “independent, fair, and transparent investigation”.The doctor had been paying a monthly rent of Rs 4,000 to the family of the accused and residing at the place for the past year.The techie’s younger sister said, “Last month, my brother came to Phaltan to recover from dengue infection. At that time, this doctor treated him, and they exchanged numbers. Some 15 days ago, the doctor proposed marriage to my brother. My brother turned down the proposal. During Diwali, the doctor seemed tense, but we thought it might be a work-related issue. She was like a family member to us, and my mother used to treat her like her own daughter. ”The police said during questioning on Saturday, the arrested techie also claimed that the doctor used to harass him by insisting that he marry her and maintain a physical relationship with her. “A large number of chats and call recordings between the accused and the deceased have been found in which she is speaking about stress, pressure, etc.” a police officer said.The police are also investigating whether the accused sub-inspector — who is also named in the FIR for rape and suicide abetment, and comes from Beed, the same district as the doctor — knew her or had any relationship with her.Following the doctor’s suicide, police discovered a note written on her palm, naming the sub-inspector and the landlord’s son for driving her to take the extreme step by subjecting her to physical and mental harassment over the past five months. Based on this note and other evidence, such as WhatsApp chats exchanged between the doctor and the techie, an FIR was registered on Friday under sections 64 (rape) and 108 (abetment of suicide) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) against the two suspects.SP Tushar Doshi said, “A woman ended her life, and there might be some truth to her allegations. We are trying to establish everything. It is a challenging case as she had not complained about this earlier. Technical evidence and WhatsApp chats will be verified, but again, that can only prove that there was sexual contact. Whether there was any blackmail angle is what the investigation will bring to the fore.”Doctors’ associations in the state demanded the transfer of the case to the state CID/SIT to ensure an independent, fair, and transparent investigation, insisting on a time-bound completion of the inquiry and the public release of its findings.Additionally, the associations are seeking accountability from administrative officers who allegedly ignored repeated complaints.Dr Sachin Patil, the president of Central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), said, “We have written to the chief minister to personally intervene in this issue and to ensure that the case is handled with utmost seriousness. There is a sense of immense grief and collective outrage amongst the medical fraternity. As per statements from her colleagues, the doctor repeatedly informed her seniors about being mentally and physically harassed by the two men. Despite clear warnings that she was under extreme distress, no effective preventive action was taken by the administration.”The Central MARD, Association of Medical Officers (AMO), and Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) have condemned the tragic death and held black ribbon protest on Saturday. In a note issued by these organisations, they have demanded immediate action and warned that if their demands are not met, doctors will intensify their agitation and initiate statewide protests.Additionally, Health Rights NGO Jan Aarogya Abhiyan (JAA) has written to the CM requesting the case be registered as “institutional murder’. Dr Abhay Shukla, the national co-convenor of JAA, said, “We believe that the death of this young doctor is caused by patriarchal attitudes, administrative apathy, and negligence within the system. We demand an independent judicial inquiry committee and also request the govt to implement a ‘Women’s Safety Policy’ in all govt hospitals across Maharashtra. ”CM Devendra Fadnavis on Friday spoke to the Satara SP and directed the immediate suspension of the sub-inspector named in the note.","The Satara police arrested a techie and a police sub-inspector on Saturday in connection with the alleged rape and abetment of suicide of a 28-year-old doctor employed at the Phaltan subdistrict hospital.

Multiple teams were deployed, and after extensive effort, the accused was traced and apprehended. He attempted to flee and even tried to jump into a sewage drain. Based on the complaint of the Australian team’s security manager, a case was registered at MIG police station,” Indore police commissioner Santosh Kumar Singh said on Saturday.“Whenever an international event is underway, specific security protocols are laid down by all stakeholders involved.An investigation will determine at which level those protocols failed or were not followed,” said Singh.“A case was registered on Thursday night and the accused identified and arrested in an intensive strategic operation,” additional DCP (crime branch) Rajesh Dandotiya said.Also watch: Accused in Australian cricketers’ molestation case caught on video limping None of the Australian players appeared at the ceremonial post-match press conference at Holkar Stadium on Saturday, despite a commanding win over South Africa. Australian coach Shelley Nitschke represented the team, addressing the media while the team chose not to respond to questions regarding the incident.Australia defeated South Africa in a commanding display at Holkar Stadium, restricting them to a total of just 97 runs. The match, which drew hundreds of fans eager to witness the ICC Women’s World Cup clash, was the final fixture of the tournament scheduled in the city.“We had received a complaint from the security manager of the Australian team stating that two female players had faced inappropriate behaviour while walking to a cafe from their hotel on Thursday morning. A case was registered on Thursday night at MIG police station and the accused Akil Khan was identified and arrested in an intensive strategic operation. He was produced before the court and sent to jail on Saturday,” additional DCP (crime branch) Rajesh Dandotiya said.A total of five matches, including the Australia-South Africa clash on Saturday, have been held at the Holkar Stadium here and many of the teams have stayed at the same hotel. Following Simmons’ complaint, lodged at MIG police station late on Thursday evening, an FIR was registered under Sections 74 and 78 of the BNS for assault or criminal force on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty and stalking.According to the FIR, the incident took place around 11am when the two players had stepped out of the hotel to visit a nearby café after informing Simmons.“At approximately 11am, two players advised me they were leaving the hotel to go to a cafe. They were planning to walk to the cafe and I had no concerns with this as they had previously been to the cafe as have several members of the Australian team,” Simmons mentioned in the FIR.“I received a live location notification from one of the players on my mobile phone at 11.08am. This message signifies an emergency distress signal to me from a player to advise they may need assistance. The players were about 500m from the hotel when she sent me a message saying a man on a motorcycle had approached them and tried to grab one of them before being confronted. He again came behind another player and touched her inappropriately before he drove off,” the FIR said.The incident took place in Indore’s MIG area, primarily a marketplace, between their hotel and the café in Saket.Simmons said that the player texted him, “Hey SoS, just sending you my live location... there’s a guy following us trying to grab us.”The man was described as around 30 years old, wearing a white shirt and black cap, and riding a black motorcycle without a helmet.The team’s liaison officers were informed and directed to go to the location to assist the players. A police patrol unit later reached the spot and escorted the cricketers back to their hotel. The complaint stated that the player later messaged again, informing Simmons that local police had arrived and helped them return safely.“I received a further message stating that a nice man in a suit in a car stopped and asked if we were alright and stated that he rang police with the guy’s bike number,” Simmons mentioned in the FIR.Ayush Jain, owner of the café, which is about 5km from the hotel the Australian team was staying in, told TOI, “Many of the Australian team members have been visiting our café in groups of threefour ever since they reached Indore on Oct 17. Nobody in the neighbourhood knew their identity, except us, since the café is thronged by many foreigners who check into nearby hotels.Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) on Saturday said it is examining “whether the players had sought security cover for the movement outside the hotel.”“The Australian team has a security officer appointed by Cricket Australia along with two security officers appointed by BCCI and the local police. It shall be examined whether the players had sought security cover or not,"" MPCA chief administrative officer Rohit Pandit told TOI .“Extremely pained and hurt by the unfortunate incident that took place with the two members of the Australian women’s cricket team. No woman deserves to face such inappropriate behaviour. This incident is painful for not just the players but for the state and city too. Madhya Pradesh, especially Indore, has always been known for its hospitality, ensuring respect and safety for its guests. This inappropriate behaviour by one person has harmed this reputation and we are all extremely sorry for this,” MPCA president Mahanaryaman Scindia posted on X.","Two Australian women cricketers were allegedly stalked and molested by a man on a street here on Thursday morning.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

CHANDIGARH: Justice Surya Kant, the most senior Supreme Court judge, is poised to assume the office of Chief Justice of India (CJI) next month. Few are aware of the extraordinary journey that brought him to the nation's highest judicial position.Unlike many who come from families with strong legal background, Justice Kant's journey began in Petwar - a nondescript village in Haryana's Hisar. He grew up far from privileges often associated with corridors of power. The first time he saw a city was when he travelled to Hansi, a small town in Hisar, for his Class X board exam.Until Class VIII, he studied in a village school that had no benches. As a student, he shared everyday responsibilities of rural life - working in fields during his spare time to support his family like any other rural boy. His father was a teacher.On formal confirmation, he will be the first Haryanvi to become CJI. He is expected to take over as 53rd Chief Justice of India on Nov 24, and slated to serve until Feb 9, 2027.Those who have worked closely with him describe Justice Kant as a jurist of deep learning and measured wisdom, admired for his balanced judgments and unwavering commitment to justice. Having served for over 14 years in Punjab and Haryana HC before his elevation as Himachal Pradesh HC Chief Justice and later as SC judge, he has consistently demonstrated a keen sensitivity toward matters concerning protection of public resources, land acquisition and compensation, victims' rights, reservation policies, and broader balance of constitutional principles.Sometime ago, while visiting his alma mater, Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, Justice Kant spoke about his early life and modest beginnings. Electricity was a rarity in Petwar, he recalled and fondly remembered studying at night with friends, huddled under dim lamps, driven by hope of securing a govt job - a goal, he said, inspired him to persevere through every hardship.Born on Feb 10, 1962, Justice Kant completed his early education from Petwar and LLB in 1984 from MDU. He started as a lawyer at Hisar district court before moving to Chandigarh to practice at Punjab and Haryana HC.Justice Kant became the youngest advocate general of Haryana at 38. In 2004, aged 42, he was elevated as a judge of Punjab and Haryana HC. Even then, he continued his academic pursuits, securing first-class-first in his master's degree in law in 2011 from Kurukshetra University's directorate of distance education.After serving as HC judge for over 14 years, he was elevated as Himachal Pradesh HC CJ on Oct 5, 2018. On May 24, 2019, he became SC judge.In his 14-year stint as HC judge in Chandigarh, Justice Kant passed several landmark judgments, including right of jail inmates to have conjugal visits or artificial insemination for progeny.He also passed an order in a case where a husband had killed his wife. While punishing the guilty, he noticed the accused had four daughters. He personally spoke with a college principal, requesting free education for the eldest daughter.In Punjab and Haryana HC, he was part of the full bench that ordered sanitisation of Dera Sacha Sauda in 2017 following violence after imprisonment of the Dera chief in rape cases and directed a central probe into financial irregularities inside it. He served as a member of governing body of National Legal Services Authority from 2007 to 2011. In SC, he was part of benches that passed several landmark judgments.As CJ of Himachal Pradesh HC, he focused on administrative reforms and improving judicial efficiency. He reaffirmed access to basic amenities constituted an integral part of the fundamental right to life enshrined in the Constitution.",Justice Surya Kant is the most senior Supreme Court judge. He is expected to take over as 53rd Chief Justice of India on Nov 24. He will be the first Haryanvi to become CJI.

Delhi prepares for grand Chhath celebration





(With PTI inputs)

Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Friday announced that October 27 (Monday) will be a government holiday to mark Chhath Puja . The decision coincides with the festival’s third day, considered the most sacred, when devotees gather along riversides and ponds to offer prayers to the setting sun.The holiday also recognises the festival’s cultural and spiritual importance, reflecting its emphasis on faith, devotion, and the harmony between humans and nature. Chhath Puja is observed through rituals that celebrate purity, gratitude towards nature, and environmental awareness, making it one of the most significant festivals in Delhi’s social calendar. Chhath Puja School Holidays will be observed in all Delhi schools, as per the official government announcement.The Delhi government has mobilised preparations at over 1,300 Chhath ghats across the city. Seventeen model ghats along the Yamuna are being upgraded with improved facilities, including tents, lighting, toilets, drinking water, and enhanced security, to ensure devotees can perform rituals comfortably and safely.During an inspection at Pochanpur Chhath Ghat in Dwarka Sector 23B, CM Rekha Gupta, accompanied by MLA Sandeep Sahrawat and members of the Chhath Puja Committee, oversaw decoration and maintenance activities, according to media reports.The initiative emphasised citizen participation alongside government efforts to turn the festival into a city-wide celebration of cultural unity.The government’s ongoing Yamuna cleaning work has been progressing over the past eight months, showing visible improvements in water quality. Coordination with neighbouring states Haryana and Uttar Pradesh has been central to the initiative, with the city administration aiming to combine environmental responsibility with festival arrangements.Earlier on Friday, the CM inaugurated a newly constructed Chhath ghat and other development projects worth ₹30 crore in Laxmi Nagar. The initiative also recognised the contributions of the Purvanchal community to Delhi’s socio-economic growth.For Chhath Puja 2025, there is no official confirmation of a public holiday in other parts of NCR including Noida or Gurugram. However, schools in both cities are likely to remain closed, following the common practice of observing regional festivals. Residents and parents are advised to check with individual schools for final closure details.With the government holiday and upgraded facilities across the Capital, Delhi is set for a large-scale Chhath celebration, blending devotion, civic planning, and environmental consciousness.","The Delhi government has mobilised preparations at over 1,300 Chhath ghats across the city.

Odisha on alert, says Revenue and Disaster Management Minister

Andhra Pradesh districts take up large-scale contingency measures

Heavy rainfall and flooding risks

As Cyclone Montha intensifies over the Bay of Bengal, both Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have gone on high alert, ordering school closures and precautionary evacuations in several coastal districts. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned of extremely heavy rainfall and gale-force winds up to 110 kmph, with the storm expected to make landfall on October 28 between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam.In Odisha, the Ganjam district administration has already shut schools and colleges until October 28, reports Kalinga TV. Meanwhile, while other southern districts including Malkangiri, Koraput, Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Gajapati, Kandhamal and Kalahandi have been marked as “red zones”, where similar closures are likely if conditions worsen. In Andhra Pradesh, Konaseema, Kakinada, East and West Godavari, and Eluru districts have implemented contingency measures, including school holidays, evacuations, and bans on fishing.According to an ANI report, Odisha Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Suresh Pujari said the state is “fully prepared” with extensive safety measures and coordination plans across departments. “The Odisha government has prepared extensively for the impending cyclone, which is currently 930 kilometres away from the Odisha coast and moving towards the west and northwest,” he said.He added that eight districts have been identified as highly vulnerable, and all departments — including energy, health, public relations, rural development, and agriculture — have been instructed to stay alert.“Cyclone centres, relief centres, and plot centres are ready... The water resources department has started releasing water from reservoirs,” Pujari said.As reported by Times News Network (TNN), Andhra Pradesh has also begun extensive preparations in at least five coastal districts including Kakinada, East Godavari, Konaseema, Eluru, and West Godavari. Local authorities have issued fishing bans, school closures, and evacuation advisories in vulnerable areas.In Kakinada, officials started moving people from Hope Island to safer zones, while in Konaseema, Collector R Mahesh Kumar ordered the closure of schools and prepared shelters for over 6,000 residents from 34 coastal villages. He added that 428 pregnant women expected to deliver within the next 15 days have been shifted to nearby health centres.In West Godavari and Eluru, schools and colleges will remain closed on October 27 and 28, and recreational activities at beaches and resorts have been suspended. Telecom operators have been instructed to deploy generators to ensure uninterrupted mobile connectivity during the cyclone.As per IMD projections, 20–30 cm of rain is likely across several coastal and southern districts of both states between October 28 and 30, accompanied by flooding, power disruptions, and possible storm surges.A Kalinga TV report highlighted intensified coastal preparedness, with visuals showing IMD forecasts and district-level mapping of rainfall risks. The channel reported that fishing has been banned, and relief and rescue teams have been positioned across Odisha’s southern coastline.Authorities in both states said coordinated efforts between disaster management, police, and energy departments are ongoing to minimise damage, with 24x7 control rooms and emergency medical teams on standby.","Cyclone Montha is expected to make landfall on October 28 between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam.

Why Virat Kohli in India XI for World Cup 2027 will be bad news | Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Opener Rohit Sharma struck an unbeaten century, Virat Kohli made a fighting half-century, and pacer Harshit Rana grabbed four wickets as India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the third and final ODI on Saturday, though they lost the series 1-2.Rana’s brilliant spell of 4/39 helped bowl Australia out for 236 in 46.4 overs, setting the stage for a dominant Indian chase. Rohit then led the way with an unbeaten 121 off 125 balls. He first shared a crucial 69-run opening partnership with Shubman Gill (24) before joining forces with Kohli (74* off 81 balls) for an unbroken 168-run stand, guiding India to the target in 38.3 overs.After reaching his half-century, Kohli initially forgot to acknowledge the crowd or celebrate, until Rohit signaled him to mark the milestone.Watch the video here During the innings, Kohli also broke another record, becoming the second-highest run-getter in ODI cricket. The No.3 batter, famously known as the 'Chase Master,' overcame subdued form in the first two ODIs to register his 75th ODI fifty and surpass 2,500 runs against Australia in the format.Kohli also surpassed Sri Lankan great Kumar Sangakkara’s tally of 14,234 runs (in 404 ODIs) in his 293rd ODI innings. The former India captain now sits just behind legendary Sachin Tendulkar , who leads with 18,426 runs. Impressively, Kohli maintains a superior average of 57.69 across 305 ODIs, compared to Tendulkar’s 44.83 in 463 matches.With his career nearing its end in ODIs, Kohli is set to finish as the second-highest run-getter behind his idol, Tendulkar.In the match, Kohli’s unbeaten 74, including seven fours, and Rohit’s 33rd ODI ton — which was also his 50th international century — powered India to a nine-wicket victory at the Sydney Cricket Ground, even as Australia secured the series 2-1. Rohit was named both Player of the Match and Player of the Series for scoring 202 runs across three games.The two sides will now clash in a five-match T20I series, beginning October 29.","India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the third and final ODI on Saturday.

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

Unlike Bihar, pan-India SIR to be announced at press meet

Also read-

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission will on Monday announce the first phase of the pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, covering 10-15 states/UTs, including poll-bound West Bengal, Tamil Nadu , Kerala, Assam and Puducherry.Sources in the poll body said the initial phase will leave out states like Maharashtra, where local body elections are to be held by Jan 31, 2026, as per Supreme Court directives, as well as the snow-bound states/UTs of J&K, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Ladakh. The last intensive revision of electoral rolls in India was undertaken two decades ago.Ahead of the EC presser, Tamil Nadu CM and DMK chief M K Stalin accused BJP of ""plotting to remove names from voter list"" ahead of state polls, as in Bihar . ""It (SIR) deprived nearly 65 lakh voters in poll-bound Bihar of their voting rights,"" he alleged.DMK and other INDIA bloc parties have warned that BJP govt is ""attempting to use EC as its puppet to replicate the same in Tamil Nadu"", Stalin said in a letter to the party cadre.""BJP and its ally AIADMK believe that if the names of voters from the working class, minorities, scheduled castes, women and the poor are deleted through SIR, they can secure victory without facing the people.But this calculation will fail in Tamil Nadu,"" he said.Unlike Bihar, where EC launched SIR with a written order, the pan-India exercise will be announced at a press conference, allowing any queries and doubts to be addressed on the spot.Sources indicated that the nationwide SIR shall be announced and conducted in stages, with three broad categories of states/UTs likely to witness the exercise later. These include states/UTs that will soon be in the grip of harsh winter and snow; ones where local body polls are due over the next three months and which are held with electoral rolls prepared as per provisions of the Representation of the People Act; and where at least 75%-80% of the electorate has already been mapped by matching current electors with entries in the roll from the last intensive revision, requiring only the remaining 20% or so to submit documents to prove their eligibility as per Article 326 of the Constitution.EC sources said the list of documents to be accepted as proof of eligibility will more or less remain the same as in Bihar and will only be indicative and not exhaustive. Aadhaar will only be accepted as proof of identity.Going by the three-month SIR schedule followed in Bihar, the enrolment stage for the first phase of SIR - requiring the elector to sign the enrolment form and, where required, submit proof of eligibility - may start on Nov 1 and the final roll published, after settling claims and objections to the draft roll, by Jan end or beginning of Feb.The groundwork for the upcoming countrywide SIR - the intent for which was announced by EC in its June 24 notification for SIR in Bihar - has been under way for the past two months, with two separate conferences of chief electoral officers held by EC in Sept and Oct. The last CEOs conference on Oct 22-23 saw EC assessing the preparedness of all state/UT CEO offices, particularly progress of the mapping of their current electors with the roll from the last intensive revision.With Bihar having shown the way, sources said, CEOs are better prepared for the SIR and the EC's confident of pulling off a cleaner, error-free electoral roll after removing duplicate entries, illegal immigrants, and dead or shifted voters. All state/UT rolls are digitised and map-ped with the roll from the last SIR, with 50%-70% electors already linked to it; booth level officers have been trained and parties urged to appoint enough booth level agents.","EC will on Monday announce the first phase of the pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.

KOLKATA: Centre has moved Supreme Court challenging a Calcutta HC order on Sept 26 to repatriate Sunali Khatun and five others, who were pushed into Bangladesh on the grounds of being illegal immigrants, within four weeks.Centre's petition, filed on Oct 22, comes amid reports the families of the six, who are from Bengal's Birbhum and were rounded up in New Delhi, are planning to plead with HC for an order to Indian authorities to implement the repatriation order. The four-week period during which Sunali, husband Danish Sheikh, their 8-year-old son Sabir, Sweety Bibi and her two minor sons were to be brought back home ended on Oct 24.A habeas corpus petition filed by Sunali's father Bhodu Sheikh in HC in Aug mentioned that she was eight months pregnant. ""Every entity has the prerogative to move a higher forum challenging an order. But considering the sensitivity of the case, involving a woman with an advanced stage of pregnancy and two sons of Sweety, it was expected that the matter would be sorted out at the earliest,"" said the lawyer who represented Sunali's family.Sunali, Danish and Sweety worked as ragpickers in New Delhi's Rohini. They were picked up on June 21 on suspicion of being Bangladeshis.On June 24, the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in New Delhi ordered they be kept in a community centre in Rohini. A deportation order was passed on June 26 and the six were pushed into Bangladesh the same day. They were arrested in Bangladesh on Aug 21 for illegally entering the country and have been in jail there since.The division bench of Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty and Justice Reetobroto Kumar Mitra had on Sept 26 scrapped the FRRO order before ordering the return of the six within four weeks. The bench criticised the Centre's submission that the burden of proof under the Foreigners Act 1946 was on the detained people, saying the law did not ""empower the executive to pick up a person at random, knock at his or her door, and tell him that he is a foreigner"".HC said Sunali's father was a permanent resident of Birbhum and the detainees had lived there for a long time since their birth.","Centre has moved Supreme Court challenging a Calcutta HC order on Sept 26 to repatriate Sunali Khatun and five others.

KOLKATA: Monica Liu lives and breathes Beijing, the 'Tangra-style' Chinese restaurant that is the beating heart of weekends in Kolkata's Chinatown. But on Sunday night, Guangzhou was on her mind. For the first time in five years, she was on a direct flight from the city she calls home to the country of her ancestors.Liu was among the first of 176 passengers to board IndiGo's resurrected Kolkata-Guangzhou flight that bridged the gap in direct air connectivity between India and China, triggered by Covid pandemic and extended by the diplomatic frost following border clashes in 2020.For someone who once travelled frequently between the two countries to visit relatives, the wait felt longer than five years for Liu. ""I am flying to meet some of my relatives back in China. I was a frequent flyer between Kolkata and China prior to Covid. Now that direct connectivity is back, I wish to resume regular travel,"" she said.The Airbus A320 Neo departed at 10pm, just over a fortnight ahead of IndiGo starting its Delhi-Guangzhou service on Nov 10. China Eastern Airlines is scheduled to resume its Shanghai-Delhi flight a day earlier.More than 40 weekly flights once linked Indian metros with Shanghai, Guangzhou and Kunming.All were suspended in 2020. Union govt's decision to reopen tourist visas for Chinese nationals paved the way for flights to resume, with Delhi and Beijing agreeing in principle to restore air services during foreign secretary Vikram Misri's trip in Jan.PM Narendra Modi's visit to China in late-Aug, his first in seven years, saw him and Chinese President Xi Jinping stress that the two countries should be seen as partners in development rather than competitors.For Arjun Gupta, a New Town businessman running a restaurant and electronics unit in China, resumption of direct flights translates into saving time and money. ""Past five years, we were forced to take a detour via Delhi and Bangkok to reach China. It was not only tiring but also extremely costly. I had to limit my travels. This direct flight takes only three-and-a-half hours and is also considerably cheaper.""Pinal Gandhi flew in from Ahmedabad just to catch the inaugural flight.

’Naxal-Maoist Terror Nearly Wiped Out Across India’: PM Modi Hails Police, CRPF, BSF

NEW DELHI:Rejecting the CPI(Maoist) central committee’s (CC) “traitor” tag thrown at him at fellow Naxal leader Bhupathi alias ‘Sonu’ in view of their recent surrender, CC member Rupesh has said that they had laid down arms in line with the slain general secretary Basavaraj ’s final call to ‘partymen’ to cease armed operations against the security forces and explore talks with the Centre.In a video statement shared with TOI, Rupesh – who is currently in Chhattisgarh – can be heard rejecting the CPI(Maoist) latest claim that Basavaraju had had a rethink on his stance favouring a ceasefire “to save the party, cadres and movement” -- communicated in multiple statements since March 2025 -- after the Centre had refrained from toning down anti-Naxal operations in ‘core’ areas of Maoists.He said that Basavaraj had instead, taking a pragmatic line in a letter sent to all politburo (PB)/CC members and a separate communication dispatched to Rupesh days before he was neutralised in an encounter, allowed cadres to retaliate with arms when cornered by the forces, while maintaining that ceasefire and talks were the only way forward. Basavaraj did leave it to the CC core committee to take a final decision in this regard – time was, in fact, sought from the govt to get the scattered CC members together for a meeting – but the top leader was killed in an encounter with the forces before this could fructify.“It is true that till B R Dada (Basavaraj) was killed in May, he maintained the view that conditions are ideal for abandoning armed struggle and starting talks with to the govt about our future,” Rupesh said, saying that every PB/CC member had received this message.“I had personally met Devji (current CPI Maoist general secretary) and another CC member after that,” he said but added that Devji was not in favour of ceasefire and talks.“Why is it that when a meeting of Dandakaranya Special Zonal committee (DKSZC) was held recently in south Bastar, the surrender plan of north sub-zonal bureau, though known to the leaders, was never brought up? Why is it that Basavaraj’s final letter to the PB/CC members has not been shown to the cadres?” Rupesh asked. This, a Chhattisgarh police officer indicated, suggests that Devji and CC members Sangram and Hidma, along with senior cadres Barse Deve and Pappa Rao, have failed to communicate the collective decision of the CPI(Maoist), taken under Basavaraj, to end armed struggle, to the lower ranks.Rupesh said the letter sent to him by Basavaraj, ruling out any ideological compromise behind the ceasefire, was shared by him and deliberated upon by cadres of the north sub-zonal bureau of the DKSZC, who passed it down to the divisional committee and area committee members. “It was a collective and conscious decision made by all of us to shun violence and return to the mainstream,” he said, adding that many of south sub-zonal committee cadres may also be wanting to follow suit.Rupesh said Vijay and Lokesh, two DKSZC leaders killed recently, had also favoured a ceasefire. Bhupathi initially opposed it but came around, he added.","A total of 21 Maoist cadres, including 13 women, surrendered with 18 weapons, in North Bastar Kanker on Sunday.

"CAC Member Flags RERA Gaps, Urges Mandatory Declaration from Builders on Pending Dues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cac-member-flags-rera-gaps-urges-mandatory-declaration-from-builders-on-pending-dues/articleshow/124830762.cms,"An AI-generated image

NEW DELHI: A member of the government’s Central Advisory Council (CAC) has told the housing ministry that mandatory registration of real estate projects under RERA has become meaningless as it doesn’t ensure compliance or protect homebuyers. He has urged the ministry to make mandatory the submission of a “declaration” by builders and their group entities before registration of any project, confirming that all dues to buyers, the authorities and courts in other projects have been cleared.In a letter to housing minister Manohar Lal Khattar, CAC member Abhay Upadhyay has suggested that any false declaration by builders result in such promoters being barred permanently from real estate business across India and imposition of heavy penalties on them.Upadhyay, who also heads FPCE, a pan-India homebuyers’ organisation, has sought urgent govt intervention to plug critical gaps in the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), which continue to leave buyers vulnerable to exploitation by builders. The homebuyers’ body has urged the ministry to issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) to all state RERA bodies until formal amendments are made to the Act.“Unlike FSSAI , where the stamp itself instills confidence that the product is safe for consumption, the RERA registration number has failed to become a symbol of trust. Instead, it has become a mere formality that builders flaunt while continuing to flout the law,” the FPCE said. It pointed out that many RERA authorities have not exercised the powers provided to them under the law to penalise errant developers or ensure compliance with their orders.Raising the issue of builders failing to complete or inordinately delaying promised amenities such as clubhouses, swimming pools and landscaped gardens, FPCE said that the existing provisions, which deal only with compensation for delay in possession, are “grossly inadequate”. It urged the ministry to issue SOPs to RERA bodies to ensure developers deposit adequate funds in escrow accounts for completion of such amenities and also compensate buyers until these are completed and made functional.The FPCE has further sought a clear exit policy for homebuyers to remove the uncertainty following a recent Supreme Court judgment that distinguished between ‘genuine homebuyers’ and ‘speculative investors’. It proposed that buyers be entitled to a full refund within one year of booking and a 90% refund thereafter, to ensure fairness and predictability.It also recommended barring developers from collecting more than 75% of the unit cost, with the remaining 25% being collected only after the project is complete in all respects and completion certificate is obtained.",A member of the government’s Central Advisory Council (CAC) has told the housing ministry that mandatory registration of real estate projects under RERA has become meaningless.

‘Not Just Trade But Cultural Partners’: PM Modi Virtually Addresses ASEAN Summit In Malaysia

Even today, Parliament closes each session with an instrumental version rather than a vocal rendition.Modi also recalled how the song's first public rendition was by Rabindranath Tagore at the 1896 session of Congress. ""Vande Mataram was composed 150 years ago, and in 1896, Tagore sang it for the first time,"" he said.Modi also paid tribute to Komaram Bheem - the tribal leader who spearheaded the Gond rebellion against the British and feudal Nizams of Hyderabad in 1928 - as well as tribal icon and freedom fighter Birsa Munda ahead of his birth anniversary on Nov 15, celebrated as 'Janajateeya Gaurav Diwas'.

Seats less reclining: Boeing 787 pilots want duty time cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/less-reclining-cockpit-seats-indian-pilots-urge-dgca-to-reduce-duty-time-for-boeing-787-planes/articleshow/124830730.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian pilots have expressed a fresh concern over the Boeing 787 Dreamliners — extended flight duty time limitation (FDTL) for them despite the aircraft’s less reclining cockpit seats that make controlled rest less effective for them.The Airlines Pilots’ Association of India has urged the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to rollback the extension given to the “already stretched” flight duty time limit (FDTL) for Boeing 787 two-man flight crew operations from 10 hours (flying time) to 10.5 hours and 13 hours of flight duty period (FDP) to 14 hours.ALPA-India has told the regulator this is a “matter of grave operational and safety concern.” The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has mandated restriction on the pilots’ seat recline function on this aircraft.The FAA “airworthiness directives (AD)” for the B787s issued late last year says: “…the fight deck door decompression panel can strike the captain’s seat headrest if a fight deck or below the fight deck rapid decompression event occurs when the seat is in a certain position…. (This order is) to address the possibility that the decompression panel could strike the captain's head or face.The unsafe condition, if not addressed, could result in serious or potentially fatal injury to the captain after a fight deck or below the fight deck rapid decompression event. ”In India, Air India operates Boeing 787s using its own planes and crew members. IndiGo also uses this planes but they are wet leased, meaning hired with pilots, from a foreign airline. So the Indian DGCA FDTL rules for Dreamliner pilots affect only Air India as of now.Multiple senior Indian pilots of this type said: “If any airline is serious about B787 safety from pilot fatigue perspective given the less cockpit seat recline on this plane that makes controlled rest for them left effective, it should reduce FDTL for its B787 pilots. However the opposite has happened and the flying time has been been extended.They strongly feel that until the corrective seat modification is implemented and the FAA AD is superseded with full recline the fight time should be limited to 8 hours or have augmented crew. ""ALPA-India president Captain Sam Thomas has written to DGCA on Sunday: “This regulatory decision appears not only unjustified but also dangerously inconsistent with global safety practices. Extending duty hours instead of mandating an augmented crew, particularly so soon after a recent fatal accident, raises serious questions about the prioritisation of flight safety over operational costs and convenience. Operating long routes with restricted rest capability, compounded by adverse weather and night operations, creates a scenario ripe for fatigue induced errors. These are not theoretical risks ,fatigue remains a well-documented factor in numerous aviation incidents worldwide.”The association has urged the regulator to “immediately withdraw the FDTL extension for two-pilot 787 operations. Mandate augmented crew (3-man operations) for all flights exceeding 8 hours or operating through the window of circadian low (2 am to 6 am). Undertake a comprehensive fatigue risk assessment in consultation with flight crew representatives before approving any further deviation from established limits. ”“This issue strikes at the heart of flight safety. The recent regulatory action, if left unaddressed, exposes not only the operating crew but also passengers and the travelling public to unnecessary and preventable risk,” Captain Thomas added.","The Airlines Pilots’ Association of India has urged the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to rollback the extension.

"Ties with Pakistan not at India's expense, says Marco Rubio -- even though it is",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ties-with-pakistan-not-at-indias-expense-says-marco-rubio-even-though-it-is-us-trump/articleshow/124829884.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

‘Indians Are Very Mature…’: US State Secy Marco Rubio’s Big Remark On US-Pakistan Ties

Revitalized US ties with Islamabad will not be at the expense of Washington’s “deep, historic, and important” ties with India, US secretary of state Marco Rubio has said amid what he saw as disquiet in New Delhi about the Trump White House’s pivot towards the military regime in Pakistan.In a chat with pool reporters on his way to the Asean meeting in Malaysia via Doha, Rubio said New Delhi had not directly communicated any unease to the US on the matter “but we know they’re concerned for obvious reasons because of the tensions that have existed between Pakistan and India historically” and “Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature.”“Look, they have some relationships with countries that we don’t have relationships with. So, it’s part of a mature, pragmatic foreign policy. I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India,” Rubio said, adding that New Delhi has to understand the US will have relations with a lot of different countries, and it currently sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan.Rubio’s remarks come at a time US-India relations, long considered a cornerstone of Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy, is under pressure given the trade and tariff tensions with New Delhi and the slack US has cut for China and Pakistan -- at India's expense.Pakistan currently has a 19 per cent tariff on its exports to the US compared to India's 50 percent.When pressed on whether India might need to reduce its reliance on Russian oil to secure a broader trade deal with the US, Rubio noted that India has already expressed interest in diversifying its oil portfolio.“The more they buy from us, the less they’ll buy from someone else,” he said, suggesting that increased US oil exports could displace India’s purchases from other suppliers, such as Russia. Yet, he avoided committing to specifics on trade negotiations, stating, “I’m not negotiating trade deals, so I’m not going to speak on that.”While Rubio appeared to be echoing the traditionalist State Department outlook that continues to hew to Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy, the Trump White House seems less enthused about it in recent weeks as the US president seeks to engage China, having realized Beijing holds many cards – from its stranglehold on rare earth elements to buying American agricultural produce.He is also transparently in thrall of Pakistan following reports of its pledge to supply rare earths minerals and its interest in crypto business run by family associates, with unvarnished admiration for the country de-facto military ruler, field marshal Asim Munir.Rubio is expected meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in Malaysia to continue the ministerial level dialogue since Prime Minister Modi chose to skip the meet, forgoing a meeting with Trump amid apparent misgivings over his grandstanding, with claims of having “solved” the India-Pakistan war – a four day clash that ended when the Pakistani director general of military ops phoned is Indian counterpart to seek a ceasefire.The state department and the national security council, both now run by Rubio – a former Senator who was once derided as “Little Marco” by Trump when he ran for GOP nomination – has had to finesse its position in line with White House priorities even as a trade agreement with India remains in limbo. According to officials who are clued into the talks, an agreement is almost ready, but it needs to be signed off by the President, and “no one has any idea if it will satisfy him. ”","‘Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature. I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India,’ Rubio said. Rubio is expected meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in Malaysia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124829862,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

BENGALURU: Isro Sunday moved the LVM-3 launch vehicle slated to launch the CMS-03 or Gsat-7R satellite meant for the Indian Navy , to the launchpad in Sriharikota.The satellite, which was initially expected to be launched in late 2024 was delayed. Utilising multiple bands to transmit voice, video and data between naval ships, submarines and aircraft, the satellite is expected to boost India’s maritime defence capabilities.In its fifth operational flight, the rocket will lift off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) carrying the 4,400kg satellite, making it the heaviest communication satellite to be launched to the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) from Indian soil.“CMS-03 is a multi-band communication satellite that will provide services over a wide oceanic region including the Indian landmass. The previous mission of LVM3 launched the Chandrayaan-3 mission, which eventually saw India become the first country to land successfully near the lunar south pole,” Isro said.With the LVM-3 on the launchpad, Isro has commenced pre-launch operations for the mission, whose launch was being watched closed in the last couple of days owing to predictions of a cyclone.“The direction of the cyclone has changed and we are now good to go for a Nov 2 launch,” a source said. TOI had reported last week that Isro was looking at a Nov 2 second launch.Following the launch of CMS-03, Isro will carry out another LVM-3 mission which will launch US private communication satellite Bluebird. “We are looking at the first week of Dec,” Narayanan had told TOI in a separate interview.","Isro Sunday moved the LVM-3 launch vehicle slated to launch the CMS-03 or Gsat-7R satellite meant for the Indian Navy.

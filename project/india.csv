Eyewear retailer Lenskart Solutions has opened its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday, aiming to raise Rs 2,150 crore through a fresh issue of shares, while promoters and existing investors will sell 12.75 crore shares via an offer for sale (OFS).The IPO will remain open till November 4 and the company is set to hit Dalal Street on November 10. Shares will be alloted to investors on November 6.Lenskart plans to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards setting up new company-operated, company-owned (CoCo) stores, expenditure on lease and rental agreements for these outlets, and investments in technology, cloud infrastructure, and brand marketing. The company has also earmarked funds for potential inorganic acquisitions and general corporate purposes.It has a price band of Rs 382–Rs 402 per share, and is seeking a valuation of over Rs 69,700 crore on the upper end.The entity’s grey market premium stood at Rs 70 per share, according to ET. This indicates that the company’s shares might list around Rs 472, a premium of 17.41%.SBI Securities has advised investors to “Subscribe for long term”, pointing to Lenskart’s strong business model and its leadership in a market that has major space to grow.The brokerage said listing gains may be limited, but the company’s integrated supply chain, better profitability metrics, and strong brand strength support its long-term growth.Ventura Securities has also given a “Subscribe” recommendation, describing Lenskart as a growth-led business. It cited the company’s technology-focused strategy, AI-driven customer engagement, and a store payback period of under one year, adding that profitability is expected to strengthen as the business expands into additional regions.Nirmal Bang, according to ET, acknowledged that the IPO appears expensive at first, but the valuation holds up when compared with modern retail peers such as Trent and Metro. The brokerage maintained a Subscribe (long-term) stance, referring to Lenskart’s brand strength, premium product mix, and international expansion plans.The company’s market debut follows a strong response in the anchor book. On Thursday, Lenskart garnered bids worth around Rs 68,000 crore from anchor investors, people familiar with the matter told PTI. The bid amount was nearly 10 times the total issue size of Rs 7,278 crore and close to 20 times the Rs 3,268-crore anchor allocation. Ahead of the IPO, SBI Mutual Fund invested Rs 100 crore, while Avenue Supermarts (DMart) founder Radhakishan Damani invested around Rs 90 crore.Founded in 2008, Lenskart began as an online platform in 2010 and opened its first physical store in 2013 in New Delhi. It now operates an omni-channel model, offering prescription eyewear, sunglasses, and contact lenses across metro, tier-1, and tier-2 cities, and has expanded internationally to Southeast Asia and the Middle East.The company designs, manufactures, brands, and retails eyewear through facilities in Bhiwadi and Gurugram, supported by regional hubs in Singapore and the UAE. Lenskart added 847 stores since FY23, taking its network to 2,806 outlets as of June 2025, 2,137 in India and 669 overseas.According to ET, the company’s revenue surged over 32% annually to Rs 6,652.5 crore, while EBITDA rose 93.4% to Rs 971.1 crore, with margins improving to 14.6% in FY25 from 6.9% in FY23. Lenskart posted a net profit of Rs 297.3 crore in FY25, compared to a net loss of Rs 63.8 crore in FY23, though the profit was aided by one-off gains.Lenskart holds an estimated 4–6% market share in India’s eyewear market, but faces competition in a sector that remains 77% unorganised, according to Redseer, placing the company at a combination of a large opportunity and a highly fragmented market. According to Redseer, Lenskart was the largest seller of prescription eyeglasses in India by volume in FY25.","Lenskart Solutions has opened its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday.

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

Expansion and technology push

Environmental balance and logistics efficiency





NEW DELHI: In a unique move, the road transport ministry has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and highway builders to create their own YouTube channels and upload regular videos of highway projects at various stages of construction.Union minister Nitin Gadkari said he has ordered the installation of hoardings with QR codes on national highways. Commuters will be able to scan these codes to view details of the contractor, consultant, and government officials responsible for the stretch, including their names and contact information.Gadkari said, “Main kyu gaali khaun? The QR code will have information of the contractor, consultant, and officers who cleared the road. If a road is bad and people are complaining about it on social media, take it seriously. From A to Z in road construction, we need ownership, sincerity, and a positive approach. Roads must be good, and they must stay good.”He emphasised that if people are paying toll, they deserve international-quality roads. “Weather or poor bitumen cannot be excuses. If the surface is not comfortable, fix it — cost may increase but comfort is non-negotiable,” Gadkari said.The minister also pushed for performance audits to identify design and maintenance lapses, promote accountability, and reward quality work. “When audits are regular, transparency increases, and excuses decrease. That’s how we should work,” he said.At the same event, road transport secretary V Umashankar on Tuesday instructed NHAI to upload such project videos for public viewing and feedback. Speaking at a CII event, he said, “We often get information and updates about projects and problems from videos uploaded by independent YouTubers. Some comments also give insight into issues. We are working to make video uploading part of project contract documents.”Officials said builders already submit drone-shot videos during construction, so making them public will not be an issue. The move aims to enhance transparency, accountability, and public participation in highway projects.Gadkari said work is underway to upgrade 25,000 km of highways to four lanes and connect major ports under a ₹2 lakh crore plan, highlighting that improved connectivity is also supporting religious tourism and adventure travel. The ministry is making precast technology mandatory in highway construction to enhance quality and speed up completion.Citing the transplantation of 8,500 trees along the Dwarka Expressway, Gadkari said the government is committed to balancing infrastructure growth with environmental sustainability.He added that improved road infrastructure will help reduce logistics and fuel costs, noting that “80% of goods traffic in India moves by road, while 18% uses other modes and only 1% by air. With better highways, logistics costs are expected to come down to single digits.”Reaffirming the government’s commitment, Gadkari said the goal is to build safe, sustainable, and modern roads that boost economic activity and improve the quality of life across India.","The road transport ministry has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and highway builders to create their own YouTube channels.

It acquitted the accused who had been sentenced to 10-year jail under POSCO Act, saying the crime was not the result of lust but love.The court highlighted that the couple are now happily married and have a child together.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih said while the man was guilty under the law, the rigidity of law should not be allowed to cause injustice. ""We are persuaded to hold that this is a case where the law must yield to the cause of justice,"" the judges ruled.The wife told the court that she wanted to lead a happy, normal, and peaceful life with him and their child born in their wedlock.""As per the law..., the appellant having been found guilty of a heinous offence, the proceedings in the present case on the basis of a compromise between the appellant and his wife cannot be quashed.

Given the peculiar facts and circumstances here, a balanced approach combining practicality and empathy is necessary,"" the bench said.The Court said that keeping the man in jail would harm the family, the victim and the child. ""While considering the offence... punishable under the POCSO Act, we have discerned that the crime was not the result of lust but love. The victim of crime herself has expressed her desire to live a peaceful and stable family life with the appellant, upon whom she is dependent, without the appellant carrying the indelible mark on his forehead of being an offender.But the court set some conditions on the man to protect the interest of wife and child. The husband must not desert them or child and must maintain them with dignity. ""If, in future, there be any default on the appellant's part and the same is brought to the notice of this Court by his wife or their child or the complainant, the consequences may not be too palatable for the appellant,"" the court said.This is not the first time the Supreme Court has stepped in to stop consensual adolescent romantic relationships from being criminalised. It invoked Article 142 in another case in May to let off a convict under POCSO Act and expressed wonder over how a girl from a village in West Bengal had fought a legal battle singlehandedly, after being abandoned by her family and ostracised by society, to get her lover released from jail.

Defence to remain major pillar of relations with US: Rajnath





India and the US inked on Friday an expansive new defence framework to strengthen their strategic partnership over the next 10 years. This comes amid indications that a trade deal is also in the works to douse the raging tariff tensions between the two countries.The 'Framework for the US-India Major Defence Partnership', inked during a meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his American counterpart Pete Hegseth on the sidelines of the Asean meet in Kuala Lumpur, supplants and builds on the one inked in June 2015.The 2025 framework aims to further transform the defence partnership by providing ""a unified vision and policy direction"" to deepen cooperation in all domains, including defence-industrial collaboration, military interoperability across land, air, sea, space and cyberspace, as well as maritime domain awareness, over the next 10 years.Officials told TOI that the intent is to ""recalibrate"" the partnership in line with ""a renewed consensus to effectively address the emerging security challenges and priorities in the region, including imperatives for deterrence, stability and safeguarding a free and open Indo-Pacific"".Defence and military cooperation over the last two decades has been the cornerstone of the overall bilateral ties, which have taken a major hit since President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on New Delhi earlier this year and due to his continuing insistence that he had brokered the ceasefire between India and Pakistan by leveraging trade deals.The upward trajectory of the defence ties, however, was evident at the Singh-Hegseth meeting. ""The framework will usher in a new era in our already strong defence partnership. It is a signal of our growing strategic convergence and will herald a new decade of partnership. Defence will remain the major pillar of our bilateral relations,"" Singh said.Hegseth, in turn, said, ""The framework advances our defence partnership, a cornerstone for regional stability and deterrence. We're enhancing our coordination, information-sharing and tech cooperation. Our defence ties have never been stronger.""India, of course, remains concerned about the signalling by the Trump administration that its Indo-Pacific strategy to counter an aggressive China is no longer a top priority, even as de-escalation in the US-China trade war took place on Thursday.Both Singh and Hegseth, however, reiterated their commitment to a free, open and rules-bound Indo-Pacific at the meeting. While Singh said the bilateral partnership was ""critical"" to ensure the region remains free from coercion, Hegseth said the US was committed to working closely with India to ensure the same.At a separate meeting with Chinese defence minister Admiral Dong Jun, Hegseth stressed the importance of ""maintaining a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific"" while voicing concerns about China's activities in the South China Sea, around Taiwan, and vis-a-vis allies and partners of the US in the Indo-Pacific. ""US does not seek conflict. It will continue to stoutly defend its interests and ensure it has the capabilities in the region to do so,"" he posted on X.The US, of course, is eyeing more lucrative Indian defence deals, having bagged contracts worth over $25 billion since just 2007. India, for instance, is slated to receive 31 armed MQ-9B Predator high-altitude long-endurance drones, ordered from the US for $3.8 billion in Oct last year, in the 2029-30 timeframe. India is also set to order another 113 GE-F404 turbofan jet engines from US firm General Electric for $1 billion to power the indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters. The delivery of 99 such engines, ordered in Aug 2021 by Hindustan Aeronautics for $716 million, recently began after a two-year delay.","The 'Framework for the US-India Major Defence Partnership' builds on the one inked in June 2015.

Congress Chief Kharge Demands Ban On RSS Citing Sardar Patel's 1948 Letter, BJP Hits Back

NEW DELHI: As Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge called for a ban on RSS citing the decision of the then home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, BJP hit back recalling comments of both Patel and Mahatma Gandhi praising RSS and accusing Kharge of using the language of fundamentalist Muslim organisations like PFI.Kharge said RSS should be proscribed because it is endangering national unity, underlining Patel banning the right-wing organisation in 1948 after its functionaries ""celebrated and distributed sweets"" in the wake of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. He accused PM Narendra Modi of disrespecting the ""iron man"" by removing in 2024 the ban on govt employees from joining RSS, and by removing chapters on Gandhi, Godse, RSS and 2002 Gujarat riots from three NCERT books.He said, ""My personal view is that RSS should be banned. If Modi & Amit Shah eulogise the ills that Patel put out in public (before banning RSS), then it should be banned. The problems of law & order are because of RSS & BJP.""BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said Patel had described RSS as an organisation of patriots days before Gandhi's assassination in Jan 1948 & echoed a similar view in a letter to its then chief M S Golwalkar in Nov 1948.""Kharge said Patel wrote to Golwalkar and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee about the decision to ban RSS. ""RSS speeches are full of communal poison... which led to Gandhi's killing. RSS people rejoiced and distributed sweets... We have no other option but to ban RSS,"" he said, adding, ""These are Patel's words. But those who killed Gandhi and think ill of Gandhi, they are telling us that Congress does not remember Patel. The two Gujarat netas (Modi and Shah) say this. They must tell what they did for the country.""Another BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said the Kapur Commission, which had probed the conspiracy behind Gandhi's killing, had absolved RSS and that the Supreme Court's verdict on similar lines is also in public domain. He said several Congress leaders, including Indira Gandhi, have spoken positively of RSS and noted that Pranab Mukherjee was also full of praise for it after he as the then President of India visited its headquarters.","Mallikarjun Kharge calls for a ban on RSS citing the decision of the then home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

‘Script Readied Over A Mth, Read Out To Parents’

MUMBAI: The ""script"" for the shocking Powai hostage crisis was apparently planned for over a month. Seventeen children had their hands tied and mouths taped at a recording studio Thursday, as everyone believed a ""hostage scene"" for a web series was being filmed. Panic set in only when the captor, Rohit Aarrya, pulled out a gun and an iron rod and threatened to kill them, according to chilling victim accounts.Police said Aarrya came prepared - rags sprayed with chemicals were placed around the duplex studio and on the floor to start a fire if things went wrong, motion detectors were fixed at the main door, and moving cameras were set up on all floors.A policeman said Aarrya had read out his web series script to 23 shortlisted children and their parents during the audition of 36 hopefuls, convincing them that a hostage scene would be filmed on the final day of a five-day shoot. ""Only 17 of the 23 children attended preparations at the studio for four days,"" he said. These ""preparations"" lulled the eight boys and nine girls, aged 10 to 15, who arrived at the studio at 8am on Thursday, into a false sense of safety.A few hours later, some children sensed something was wrong and began screaming. That, said a cop, enraged Aarrya. ""He began waving an airgun and an iron rod at us, shouting he would kill us all,"" recalled one of the girls.""It was only then that we realised this was no longer fiction.""When police entered, they found the children with their mouths taped, and some with their hands tied. They had been denied food for hours as Aarrya kept shifting them from one room to another. ""While negotiating over phone, we could hear children screaming. He watched us from behind closed sliding glass doors with dark curtains. At intervals, he would run back into the room and drag five children out,"" said an officer. ""This continued for almost two hours,"" he added.At least 15 children were confined to a room on the upper floor. ""The studio had two floors. There were two rooms, a narrow passage, and a small hall on the lower floor, while upper floor had two rooms, a hall, a passage, and a toilet,"" the officer said. It is alleged Aarrya carried a petrol can to threaten the children. One girl's 75-year-old grandmother was also trapped inside.Aarrya's production assistant, Rohan Aher, was locked in a separate room and threatened at gunpoint. Aher told cops he had no idea of Aarrya's plan. Aarrya was listed as the producer, scriptwriter, and planner of the series. ""We didn't know he had weapons or inflammable material,"" Aher said, adding he managed to speak to police officers through a window while Aarrya was in another room talking to police and parents.Aarrya had also recorded a video stating he had abandoned thoughts of suicide and planned the ""hostage"" situation to get his ""demands"" met. Police said the video was sent via WhatsApp to two acquaintances from the auditions at 1.45pm Thursday, who alerted police. A team reached the site by 2.15pm, and after nearly two hours of negotiations, the operation ended with Aarrya's death by 4pm.","Rohit Aarrya, a producer, scriptwriter, and planner of a web series, held 17 children hostage at a recording studio in Mumbai.

NDA manifesto ‘blueprint for state’s progress’: PM Modi

PATNA: The NDA on Friday made a welfare and aspirational pitch in the Bihar assembly elections, countering RJD's govt job campaign with the promise of creating over one crore employment opportunities, including in govt, based on an elaborate skill census.It also sought to consolidate crucial support bases, such as extremely backward class (EBC) voters, with the alliance's joint manifesto promising a high-level committee to assess the socio-economic status of each community and steps to empower them.The allies, led by BJP and JD(U), unveiled a plan to top up the Rs 6,000 PM-KISAN support with a Rs 3,000 annual payout. Besides, there is the promise of free education ""KG to PG"", and a Panchamrit Guarantee - free electricity up to 125 units, free foodgrain, free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh, 50 lakh new houses, and pensions.NDA promised an infrastructure boost in Bihar to bring it on a par with other states through a focus on development, be it new cities - including New Patna and Sitapuram, a greenfield project near Sitamarhi - rapid rail, seven new expressways, or more airports and bringing direct international flights to four airports. A new airport near Patna and one in Bhagalpur are also planned.The manifesto, jointly released by CM Nitish Kumar, Union minister and BJP national president J P Nadda, JDU national working president Sanjay Kumar Jha, Union ministers Jitan Ram Manjhi and Chirag Paswan, and RLM chief Upendra Kushwaha, contains 25 key points.""We will build world-class medical institutions, complete construction of approved medical colleges in every district, set up modern super-specialty hospitals dedicated to children and autism and a dedicated 'centre of excellence' for identified priority sportspersons in every division,"" said deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary.In an outreach to another key constituency, the manifesto has announced assistance of up to Rs 2 lakh under the CM Mahila Rozgar Scheme for women, and vowed to create one crore 'Lakhpati Didis' along with 'Mission Crorepati'.Apart from the monthly financial assistance of Rs 2,000 to scheduled caste students pursuing higher education, the manifesto pledges financial aid of up to Rs 10 lakh for EBC youths for self-employment.The emphasis on jobs was a clear focus given the discourse around migration and failure to create employment. But unlike RJD's pitch for one govt job for every family, BJP's emphasis is on skilling and creating the platform for employment.The Rs 1 lakh crore Developed Bihar Industrial Mission, complete with 10 new industrial parks and a Rs 50 lakh crore investment target, are meant to lay the foundation. There will be emphasis on defence manufacturing, global capability centres, creating an AI hub and a tech and fintech city as the NDA seeks to ensure that there are enough jobs within the state, which also addresses concerns over migration. MSMEs were pitched as the other area of emphasis, again aimed at creating employment while also meeting the requirements of large industries.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday described the NDA’s election manifesto for Bihar as “a blueprint for the state’s progress and aspirations”, asserting that it reflected the alliance’s resolve to turn Bihar into a developed and self-reliant state. “The NDA’s sankalp-patra for the Bihar assembly elections clearly presents our vision for an Atmanirbhar and Viksit Bihar,” Modi said.He added, “It reflects our commitment to improving the lives of farmers, youth, mothers and sisters, and all families of Bihar. The state’s double-engine govt has spared no effort for all-round development, and we are determined to accelerate these efforts further to make good governance the foundation of prosperity for every citizen.” Modi expressed confidence that “the people of Bihar will wholeheartedly support our efforts. ” The NDA manifesto promises wide-ranging welfare and infrastructure initiatives.Home minister Amit Shah echoed the PM, saying NDA under Modi and Nitish Kumar’s leadership is “committed to building a developed Bihar”. “Today, NDA has released its sankalp-patra to speed up development reaching every section of society. From heritage to high-tech innovation, Bihar is ready for a giant leap,” Shah said, adding a dedicated Flood Management Board and the ‘Flood to Fortune’ initiative would make Bihar flood-free.","NDA promises to create over one crore employment opportunities, including in govt, based on an elaborate skill census.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday called for a ban on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), linking it to what he described as widespread law and order problems in the country. “It is my personal opinion, it should be done,” Kharge said when asked whether the RSS should be banned, adding that “most of the issues and law and order problems are arising because of the BJP-RSS. ”Referring to the Congress’ role in India’s freedom struggle, Kharge said, “People today comment on a party whose members sacrificed their lives for the country. But if we say something about the RSS, we are directly attacked.” Citing Sardar Patel’s letter to Syama Prasad Mookerjee dated 4 February 1948, he added, “The way the RSS expressed joy over Mahatma Gandhi’s death had worsened the situation, leaving the government with no choice but to act against it. Reports confirmed that the activities of the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha created an atmosphere that led to Gandhi’s assassination.”Speaking at a press conference in Delhi, Kharge accused the Modi government of rewriting history and distorting the legacy of national icons. “On 9th July 2024, the Modi government lifted the 58-year-old ban on government employees participating in RSS activities. We demand that this lifting be set aside.The organisation was banned by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,” he said.Kharge criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for what he described as attempts to distort history.“Recently, references to Mahatma Gandhi, Godse, the RSS, and the 2002 Gujarat riots have been removed from NCERT books. Erasing the truth from textbooks is not right—it reveals their intentions. They always try to turn lies into truth. Our Prime Minister is an expert in this, and his followers are walking the same path. Sardar Patel had banned the RSS to protect secularism,” he said.Responding to PM Modi’s remarks on Sardar Patel’s role in uniting Kashmir, Kharge said the Prime Minister was trying to create a false divide between Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru. “They always tried to portray a rift between Nehru and Patel when they had great ties and both had praised each other,” Kharge said, adding that Patel had called Nehru “an ideal for the country.”","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge calls for a ban on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Citing Sardar Patel’s letter to Syama Prasad Mookerjee dated 4 February 1948, he added, “The way the RSS expressed joy over Mahatma Gandhi”s death had worsened the situation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124989092,imgsize-959067,width-400,resizemode-4/kharge-during-a-press-conference-in-new-delhi.jpg"

PATNA: After decades of being the face of RJD, patriarch Lalu Prasad is ceding political space to his son Tejashwi Yadav as INDIA bloc's Bihar chief ministerial candidate takes centre stage in a poll campaign designed to recast the party's image around the heir.Lalu, still the RJD president, doesn't feature in any of the poll posters projecting Tejashwi as Bihar's ""nayak"" and promising momentous changes if he is elected CM. The ailing former CM and Union minister hasn't been seen in public either, although his wife Rabri Devi, also a former CM, did travel to Raghopur recently.So, is Lalu's health the only reason he isn't part of the campaign or has one of Bihar's most influential political figures over several decades outlived his utility?RJD sources said that Lalu receding into the background is part of a conscious attempt to neutralise the negative factors associated with the state's main opposition party. RJD's 15-year stint in govt still invites ""jungle raj"" jibes from NDA, with Lalu being painted as the central figure.Sources added that the patriarch, known for his witty asides and retorts, is still active on social media platforms, targeting his rivals with his trademark one-liners.""Lalu's name or posters featuring him provide fodder to NDA to target us. So, the party brass has cleverly planned to keep him out of poll campaign this time, focusing on Tejashwi instead,"" said an RJD functionary.In 2020, Tejashwi came close to forming govt, with only 12 seats separating the RJD-led alliance from NDA. The gap in total votes polled for both sides was 11,150.The general impression is that Tejashwi is being extra cautious this time about not wading into any controversy. He is also trying to ""give a touch of positivity to the campaign"", talking about providing jobs to every family, regularising services of contractual workers in govt departments, and ending migration.His favourite pitch? ""Just give me a chance, and I will do in 20 months what wasn't done in 20 years."" And all of this without once mentioning his famous father's name.","Lalu doesn't feature in any of the poll posters projecting Tejashwi as Bihar's ""nayak"" The ailing former CM and Union minister hasn't been seen in public either.

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.",KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to prevent fraud.

India backs Turkiye rival Cyprus





NEW DELHI: India backed Afghanistan's announcement that it will build a dam on the Kunar river, saying it stands ready to support Afghanistan in sustainable water management, including on hydroelectric projects. Amidst Afghanistan-Pakistan tensions, the govt also reiterated its position that it is fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.On the dam issue, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said there's a history of cooperation between India and Afghanistan on such issues, including the Salma Dam in Herat province.Afghanistan last week announced plans to begin construction of a dam on the Kunar river that flows into Pakistan's northwestern region, raising concerns in Islamabad about likely restriction on the flow of water into the country. Pakistan is faced with similar concerns emanating from India's decision to put in abeyance the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a Word Bank-brokered water sharing agreement between the two countries, after the Pahalgam terrorist attack.""Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories.

They don’t have any locus standi to speak on matters which are internal to India,” said the MEA spokesperson.The OIC general secretariat had released a statement Monday in which it reiterated “full solidarity with the people of J&K in their legitimate quest for the right to self-determination”.Amidst India’s strained relationship with Turkiye, MEA S Jaishankar reiterated New Delhi’s “unwavering” support for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Republic of Cyprus, which does not have diplomatic ties with Ankara, in line with relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. In a meeting with his visiting counterpart Constantinos Kombos, the minister also appreciated Cyprus’s consistent support on issues of core interest to India, especially in the battle against cross-border terrorism and India’s bid to become a permanent member of the security council.","Afghanistan last week announced plans to begin construction of a dam on the Kunar river that flows into Pakistan's northwestern region.

MUMBAI: A 45-year-old social entrepreneur who ran a project for the state govt held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series.The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations. Police said they shot him in the chest in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.Police said Aarrya owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes and had extensively worked with children.They said he had been holding auditions at RA Studio in Powai for the past five days for a web series he was planning. Thursday was the final casting call.Auditions began at 10am and the children—hailing from Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and other parts of the state—arrived earlier, said a security guard at Mahavir Classik, which housed the studio.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative’s Chembur flat for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted “simple answers” to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him.In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted “to be heard”. “Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,” he said.The captor, Rohit Aarrya , was a social entrepreneur and project management consultant who owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile showed he was an alumnus of Symbiosis International University, Pune, and had completed an executive MBA from ISB, Mumbai.He had worked extensively with children on the central govt’s Swacchh Bharat initiative, saying he was inspired by PM Narendra Modi’s plan for cleanliness in public spaces.Since 2017, Aarrya had engaged actors, including Prem Chopra, to enact short videos to generate awareness. He claimed actor Ramesh Deo as his mentor. His social media profiles contain pictures of ministers and a few celebrities.He said he had taken the children hostage “according to a plan”. “I really want to conduct the ‘Let’s Change’ programme. I am going to do it. If I am alive, then I will do it. If I die, then someone else will do it. But it will definitely happen,” he said.His tone then turned menacing. “It will happen with these kids only if they are not harmed. Because the slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this place on fire and die in it.Whether I die or not, the kids will definitely be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised. I don’t know what will happen to them. If something does happen to them, I should not be held responsible.""Those persons should be held responsible who are triggering this unnecessarily, when a normal, common person just wants to talk. After my discussions are over, I will come out myself. I am not alone. I have more people with me. Many people have similar problems as mine. And I am going to give this solution only by talking. Please do not trigger me to do some harm to anybody.”Police spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with the captor, Rohit Aarrya, and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls’ parents said she suffered from seizures, cops said. An official said he appeared calm when police spoke to him.City police chief Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing.“Regardless of his demands, we couldn’t let him play with lives. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option.”Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the priority, adding that the team’s response was measured and as per the protocol. The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry.","Rohit Aarrya, 45, held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai.

"" ""After Independence, Sardar Patel accomplished the seemingly impossible task of uniting over 550 princely states. For him, the vision of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat' was paramount,"" he said adding that, ""Sardar Patel believed we should not waste time in writing history but creating it; he created history by unifying India.""""The missteps taken by Congress in governing Kashmir have caused the region and the nation to endure decades of turmoil.Weak and ineffective policies allowed a significant portion of Kashmir to be illegally occupied, setting the stage for Pakistan to fuel and promote terrorism.

They strayed from the visionary ideals of Sardar Patel, but we have not forgotten those principles,"" he further added.Before the above tribute, PM Modi also shared a video in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's honour, describing his life and highlighting his achievements.""India pays homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 150th Jayanti.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday criticised Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , alleging that Gandhi insulted the Chhath Puja festival as he is ignorant of India's culture since Italy is his ""maternal home"".Addressing multiple rallies in Bihar, Shah said the INDIA bloc will be ""wiped out"" and that voters would ""avenge"" what he called an ""insult to Chhathi Maiyya"". He also referred to an earlier incident where Congress workers in the state allegedly abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mother.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had held one of his election meetings in the Muzaffarpur on Wednesday, and alleged that the PM had tried to enact a ""drama"" by planning to take a dip in the Yamuna at Delhi, on the occasion of Chhath Puja.He had alleged that Modi gave up his plans to take a dip when it came to light that the spot he had chosen was a puddle created with clean, piped water, since the Yamuna was extremely polluted and not fit for a bath.""Rahul baba has said Modi and others who worshipped Chhathi Maiyya were indulging in drama. His maternal roots are in Italy, and hence he has no idea about the country's culture,"" Shah said, as quoted by PTI. He asked voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy"".The home minister accused the Congress and its allies of preventing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He said, ""thwarting for 70 years"" the construction of the temple, which he said had been a matter of struggle ""since the times of the Mughals, and continued under the British"".Shah praised the Modi government for developing a new university at Nalanda, saying ""no Bakhtiyar Khilji will be able to destroy"" it. He also mentioned an ongoing project worth about Rs 850 crore to develop Punaura Dham in Sitamarhi district, which is linked to the birthplace of Goddess Sita. ""In two years from now, you will see PM Modi performing the consecration ceremony (pran pratishtha) at Punaura Dham,"" he said.At a rally in Nalanda, Shah opened his speech with references to Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. He then criticised the previous RJD governments led by Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, saying Bihar witnessed ""over 32,000 kidnappings and 12 major massacres"" during their tenure. He said, ""Nitish Kumar ended the ‘jungle raj’... but RJD is trying to bring back ‘jungle raj’ in the state with a new face.""Shah rejected claims by Tejashwi Yadav that the NDA would take back money deposited in women’s accounts under welfare schemes. ""Nobody can dare to take that money back. RJD leaders must give up this diatribe,"" he said.The home minister said that during Nitish Kumar’s time in power, ""there has been a 20 per cent drop in murders while dacoities and kidnappings have gone down by 80 per cent"". He added, ""We are preparing the youth of Bihar to win medals in the 2036 Olympics that will happen in India.""","Amit Shah takes 'Italy' Jibe at Rahul Gandhi after Cong MP Targets PM Modi over Chhath 'Nautanki' He asks voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124980899,imgsize-681244,width-400,resizemode-4/lkn-35.jpg"

Bengaluru Road Rage Horror: Delivery Boy Chased, Crushed To Death By Martial Arts Trainer Couple

Victim Darshan

The accused, Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30)





BENGALURU: A chilling CCTV footage has emerged showing a Kalaripayattu trainer and his wife deliberately mowing down a 24-year-old food delivery agent in a fit of rage — and returning to the crime scene later to collect broken car parts.Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident that killed Darshan, a resident of Kembattalli.The couple, married for five years, has been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.The CCTV footage, accessed by police from Nataraja Layout in South Bengaluru, has revealed the sequence of events that turned a minor brush on the road into a murder.Also read: Delivery boy chased, crushed after road rage spat; martial arts trainer, wife arrested for murder Around 9pm, Darshan’s gearless scooter accidentally brushed against Kumar’s car, slightly damaging its right-side rear-view mirror. Though Darshan apologised and sped away — as he was on his way to deliver food — Kumar allegedly lost his temper.“Losing control of himself, he took a U-turn, chased the scooter, and rammed it from behind,” said a senior investigating officer. “The impact threw Darshan and his pillion rider Varun onto the road.The car didn’t stop.”Locals rushed the duo to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared Darshan brought dead. His sister later filed a hit-and-run case with JP Nagar traffic police.But when investigators examined the CCTV footage, they were stunned. “To our horror, we discovered it was not an accident. The driver deliberately veered left and rammed into the scooter,” a senior officer said.Further footage showed the same car returning to the accident site around 9.40pm. “The couple, wearing masks, parked nearby and collected parts of their car that had broken off during the impact. As they left again, CCTV cameras captured their faces clearly,” the officer added.The footage helped police identify the car and trace the couple to their residence. Deputy commissioner of police (South) Lokesh Jagalasar confirmed the arrests, saying, “The accused have confessed to their involvement.”While Manoj claimed he was alone during the ramming and that Aarati had only accompanied him later to retrieve the car parts, police said they are verifying his version.Darshan, a bachelor, is survived by his parents and sister. His family is demanding strict action against the accused.","Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident.

'Mohammad's son': Owaisi raises Muslim leadership demand; will it dent Mahagathbandhan prospects in Bihar elections?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mohammads-son-owaisi-raises-muslim-leadership-demand-will-it-dent-mahagathbandhan-prospects-in-bihar-elections/articleshow/124933555.cms,"Photo/Agencies

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

Tejashwi avoids reaction to Owaisi

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan, questioning why the alliance has not named any Muslim leader as its deputy chief minister face for the Bihar elections Addressing supporters, Owaisi said, ""Sitting next to Tejashwi Yadav, Mukesh Bhai of the VIP Party, confident in his community's history, declared that the Malla community is with Tejashwi. The Malla community represents 3% of Bihar's population. He declared that if they gain power, he will become the deputy CM... If a Malla's son will become the deputy chief minister, what will the 17% minority community in Bihar do? Are they only to spread 'Dari ' (carpet)?""He added, ""If a Malla's son can become the deputy chief minister, then Mohammad's son can also become the Prime Minister or chief minister. Nothing can stop us from achieving our goals. Remember, the more you dream, the more you trust in Allah's will, and the more you strive along the way, the more you will see the clearer the path will become.""On Tuesday, Owaisi had raised a similar question. He said, ""Why cannot a Muslim, who represents 17 per cent of the state's population, become the chief minister? After all, they seem to have no problem with promising the deputy CM's post to a person who represents only three per cent of the population.""He criticised Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party, saying these parties seek Muslim votes without offering leadership roles. Owaisi said, ""Parties like Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party seek votes of Muslims, cashing in on the minority community's fear of the BJP. These parties have not been able to stop the BJP but are still trying to get the votes of Muslims under the same pretext.""He also targeted the BJP. Owaisi said, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims to take all along and strive to work for the progress of all. But his party fails to give tickets, in elections, to a single Muslim.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav declined to respond to Owaisi’s remarks. When asked, he said, ""Leave it. What can I say about it?"" Tejashwi is the Mahagathbandhan’s declared chief minister candidate.In the previous assembly elections, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four of its MLAs later moved to the RJD.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, AIMIM contested 20 seats and won five, all from the Seemanchal belt. Seemanchal includes Araria, Katihar, Kishanganj and Purnia, located close to the West Bengal border. The Muslim population in Bihar is around 17.7%, and Muslims form about 40% of the population in at least 11 constituencies. They have a decisive influence on around 47 seats.The four districts of Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar have 24 seats that will go to polls in the second phase. These districts have a high Muslim population. For many years, this region was seen as a strong area for the RJD and Congress. Owaisi first contested here in 2015 but did not win.Before the 2020 elections, AIMIM won a bypoll seat in Kishanganj. In 2020, the party won five seats — two each in Kishanganj and Purnia, and one in Araria. This changed the electoral maths in multiple seats, reducing the RJD-Congress vote share. The NDA finally defeated the Opposition by a slim margin, where a difference of only 12,000 votes separated the two sides in the final seat tally.The Mahagathbandhan released its manifesto on Tuesday, titled 'Bihar Ka Tejashwi Pran'. It promises that within 20 days of forming the government, a law will be passed to give one government job per family.The 2025 Bihar assembly elections will take place between the National Democratic Alliance (BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha) and the Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM and VIP).Polling will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan.

Rare earth nod comes with no-export rider





NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

The Storm then also came out and mocked Stratton, leading her to go after Cargill until security intervened to keep them separated.As Nathan Frazer was making his way to answer Ilja Dragunov's US title open challenge, Tomasso Ciampa came down to try and take his opportunity. However, Dragunov instead chose Frazer, and both superstars gave a highly captivating and intense match that led to fans erupting in a 'This is Awesome' chant.Following the exciting bout, the last minute saw Dragunov hit the H-bomb on Frazer to retain his title.

What It Means for Atlanta

Thecould be preparing to make one of the biggest moves of the 2026 offseason, potentially acquiring. A trade for Skubal, whose projected market value hovers around $400 million, would form a dominant rotation trio alongside Chris Sale and Spencer Strider, instantly elevating the Braves’ World Series aspirations.Heading into 2026, Atlanta Braves’ front office - led by Alex Anthopoulos - is expected to focus heavily on both the bullpen and starting rotation. The bullpen remains the team’s most pressing concern after inconsistencies during key moments of the 2025 season.One key decision involves reliever Tyler Kinley, who emerged as one of the most reliable arms for the Atlanta Braves last year.“So far, he’s proved to be a steal. In 21 games pitched since coming to Atlanta, Kinley has a 0.41 ERA and a 0.73 WHIP over 22 innings of work. He’s averaging nearly a strikeout per inning as well. It was a low-risk gamble that brought high reward,” wrote SI’s Harrison Smajovits. (H/t: Sporting News)For just $6.5 million, the Braves have the opportunity to retain a quality late-inning option. If Kinley continues his impressive form, this decision could be one of the most cost-effective bullpen moves of the offseason.While bullpen reinforcements are vital, the Braves are reportedly eyeing a blockbuster trade for Tarik Skubal, one of MLB’s most dominant starting pitchers. Skubal has just one year of team control remaining, which could make him available if the Tigers look to maximize his trade value before free agency.HTHB’s Eric Cole highlighted the potential challenge and magnitude of the move: “Okay, this is the big one and also the toughest one to pull off. The Braves want starting pitching depth and there is a good chance that soon-to-be multiple Cy Young winning Tarik Skubal is available in the right trade.”Cole also suggested that a trade package similar to the one used to land Kyle Tucker last offseason could be a realistic starting point for negotiations.Here’s the revised and properly formatted table you asked for:While such a deal would come at a steep cost, the payoff could be enormous. Adding Skubal would immediately create one of the most fearsome pitching rotations in the league.If the Atlanta Braves were to acquire Skubal, their projected top three starters would be:1. Tarik Skubal – Cy Young contender, elite left-hander2. Chris Sale – Veteran ace with championship pedigree3. Spencer Strider – Strikeout machine and franchise cornerstoneAtlanta would be a nightmare for opposing hitters thanks to this trio's ideal combination of power, experience, and left-right balance.For General Manager Alex Anthopoulos, landing Tarik Skubal would be a career-defining move - one that could be remembered for years in Atlanta Braves history. It would not only reinforce the team’s championship window but also address the long-term stability of the rotation as veterans age.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets predicted to land $150 million Philadelphia Phillies star to bolster team and title chances As Eric Cole summarized, this would be “the toughest one to pull off,” but it’s exactly the kind of bold decision that could make the Atlanta Braves unstoppable in 2026 and beyond. If Anthopoulos pulls the trigger, this could be remembered as the defining trade that set the stage for another Braves dynasty.","The Atlanta Braves could be preparing to make one of the biggest moves of the 2026 offseason, potentially acquiring.

Taylor Swift’s choreographer reveals how she overcame her dance anxiety





Taylor Swift’s work ethic and vision impressed her creative team





Even for someone as globally celebrated as Taylor Swift , confidence hasn’t always come easily, especially when it comes to dancing. While the 14-time Grammy winner is known for commanding the stage with charisma and storytelling, her choreographer Mandy Moore recently revealed that Swift once struggled deeply with how the world viewed her as a performer.According to Moore, the pop icon was “really in her head” after years of being unfairly criticized for her dance moves. But through hard work, creativity, and a little self-acceptance, Swift turned that insecurity into one of her biggest strengths, transforming her stage presence into a symbol of empowerment and authenticity that defined her record-breaking Eras Tour.Mandy Moore, the creative mind behind Swift’s Eras Tour choreography, told The Mirror that the singer had “gotten a bad rap for a long time about her dancing.” To help her break free from that self-consciousness, Moore decided to focus on Swift’s natural movement rather than forcing traditional dance routines.“We shifted the focus to how movement was already manifesting in her body — the way she naturally wanted to move,” Moore explained. “And then we fine-tuned that, ‘OK, that looks a little weird with your shoulders,’ or, ‘Let’s straighten your knee here.’”The choreographer’s approach celebrated Swift’s individuality rather than suppressing it, allowing her to find confidence in being uniquely herself, a quality that fans connected with deeply during her tour.Moore praised Swift’s dedication and clarity of vision, telling The New York Times, “I really admire Taylor’s tenacity. She works so hard. Whatever I was putting down, she was picking up. And she’s very clear about what she wants, which I love.”That discipline and creative focus not only helped Swift regain confidence in her dancing but also cemented her status as a true performer. As she continues preparing for her upcoming documentary Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era, her journey from insecurity to empowerment proves that even the world’s biggest star is still evolving and inspiring others to do the same.Also Read: Plans for kids already in motion as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce plan their 2026 nuptials","Taylor Swift’s choreographer, Mandy Moore, revealed the pop icon's past dance anxieties stemming from public criticism.

Born in Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, Yoervis Medina’s journey to the big leagues began when he signed with the Seattle Mariners as a 16-year-old amateur free agent in 2005. His determination and raw talent quickly made him a standout in the Mariners’ farm system.After seven years in the minors, Medina finally got the call every player dreams of, it was his MLB debut in April 2013.During his three seasons in the majors, Medina became a reliable arm in Seattle’s bullpen, posting a 2.82 ERA with 147 strikeouts in 141 appearances. Known for his hard fastball and sharp breaking pitches, the right-hander was often praised for his ability to handle high-pressure situations. In May 2015, Medina was traded to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for catcher Welington Castillo, marking the end of his time in Seattle.Although his stint with the Cubs was brief, Medina left behind a reputation for his work ethic and passion for the game. After his MLB chapter, he continued to play internationally, competing in the Venezuelan Winter League and later joining professional teams in Italy and the Czech Republic.Throughout his baseball career, Medina was respected by teammates and coaches alike for his quiet leadership and humility. He may not have been a household name, but those who played alongside him remember his calm nature and love for the sport.His death has been another painful loss for the Mariners family, coming just weeks after the passing of former prospect Jesús Montero in a separate accident in Venezuela. Medina’s name is expected to be written in the Mariners’ history book, celebrating his baseball journey.Also Read: Dodgers receive inspiring World Series boost as Magic Johnson sends emotional pre–Game 6 message of belief","Former Seattle Mariners pitcher Yoervis Medina has passed away at the age of 37.

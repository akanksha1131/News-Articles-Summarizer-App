Separately, Virat Kohli ended his illustrious 14-year Test career, having scored 9,230 runs and 30 centuries, while choosing to forgo a farewell match.Multiple sources have confirmed to TOI that the Indian armed forces utilized a wide range of space-based assets, including both domestic and international commercial sources, for Operation Sindoor. In addition to the 9–11 military satellites directly accessible to the armed forces, Isro facilitated access to ""repeatable"" data from a global commercial provider. A senior official said that while imagery from Indian satellites such as those in the Cartosat series was used for planning, satellite images were also procured from Maxar.

On Sunday, Lt general Ghai declared that India would deliver a ""fierce and punitive response"" to any such violations, with Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi granting commanders ""full authority"" to carry out kinetic counteraction against further provocations.

How AI is reshaping the doctor’s role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-ai-is-reshaping-the-doctors-role/articleshow/121113979.cms,"Digestive Disease Week (DDW) held in San Diego, California

ASGE president Prateek Sharma and Microsoft leader Eric Horvitz discuss the impact of AI in healthcare

Both speakers underscored the importance of thoughtful, clinically grounded progress.

During Digestive Disease Week (DDW) held in San Diego, California and attended by more than 12,000 physicians, Dr. Prateek Sharma, President of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), and Dr. Eric Horvitz, Chief Scientific Officer at Microsoft, explored the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare.Their conversation highlighted how AI is shaping patient care, improving efficiency in the physician's office, and redefining the role of the clinician. Both their fireside chat and individual lectures at the Presidential Plenary Session drew a large and engaged audience, which reflects the increased interest of integrating AI in healthcare.Dr. Sharma shared real-world examples of how AI is already transforming gastroenterology, from computer-aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx) in endoscopy to workflow optimisation and predictive modelling. He emphasised that the speciality is entering a point where AI reduces documentation burden, scheduling tools improve clinic flow, and how digital twins may one day enable real-time coaching during procedures.Dr. Horvitz, who leads Microsoft’s health and AI initiatives, discussed broader trends in the field, highlighting AI’s growing role in early disease detection and clinical decision support. He emphasised that AI systems should assist rather than replace human intelligence, serving as tools that support, not override, clinical judgment.He also touched on the need for explainable AI, stating that systems must be transparent and trustworthy if they are to be safely adopted into practice. Both speakers acknowledged that as AI capabilities accelerate, so do challenges facing their integration into clinical practice. Dr. Sharma emphasised the importance of clinical validation, integration across platforms, and policy reform. Dr. Horvitz echoed his concerns, along with the need for ethical guardrails that evolve alongside the technology. Dr. Sharma emphasized that tomorrow’s clinicians must be fluent in AI.“AI won’t replace you, but a gastroenterologist who knows how to use AI might”, he said. Both leaders agreed that training must include interdisciplinary learning to responsibly evaluate and deploy AI tools. Dr. Horvitz added that doctors must be involved from day one in AI development to ensure these tools are clinically relevant and usable for patient needs.As AI continues to advance, both speakers underscored the importance of thoughtful, clinically grounded progress. They encouraged healthcare professionals to stay informed, engage with new technologies, and contribute their perspectives to ensure AI evolves in ways that serve patients, providers, and the healthcare system. The conversation made clear that shaping the future of AI in medicine is not just a technical challenge, but a clinical responsibility.","During Digestive Disease Week (DDW) held in San Diego, California, Dr. Prateek Sharma and Dr. Eric Horvitz explored the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare.

‘Operation Sindoor a new benchmark in war on terror’: Excerpts from PM Modi’s address,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-pakistan-tensions-operation-sindoor-a-new-benchmark-in-war-on-terror-excerpts-from-pm-modi-address/articleshow/121124493.cms,"PM Modi addresses nation

Wiped out terror HQ

Pakistan prepared for border hit, we struck at its heart

Will give befitting reply to terrorists on our terms

Every Indian must be able to live in peace

First of all, on behalf of the people of India, I salute the valiant forces of India, the Armed Forces, our intelligence agencies, and our scientists. Our brave soldiers displayed immense courage to achieve the objectives of Operation Sindoor . I pay tribute to their bravery, courage and valour. I dedicate this valour to every mother, every sister and every daughter of the country.The barbarity displayed by terrorists in Pahalgam on April 22 had shocked the entire country and the world. The merciless killing of innocent citizens in front of their family and their children on the basis of their religion was a very gruesome face of terror and cruelty. This was also a disgusting attempt to break the harmony and unity of the country. For me personally, this was very painful. After this terrorist attack, the entire nation, every citizen, every community, every class, every political party, unitedly stood up for strong action against terrorism. We gave full freedom to the Indian forces to wipe out the terrorists. And today every terrorist, every terror organisation knows the consequence of wiping out the Sindoor of our sisters and daughters.Operation Sindoor is our unwavering commitment to justice. Late night of May 6 and in the early morning of May 7, the whole world saw this pledge turn into reality. Indian forces attacked terror hideouts in Pakistan and their training centres with precision. The terrorists had never imagined that India could take such a big decision. But when the country is united, endowed with the spirit of Nation First and national interest is paramount, then strong decisions are taken, and results are achieved.When India’s missiles and drones attacked terrorist bases in Pakistan, not only the buildings of terrorist organisations but their courage also was shaken badly. Terrorist bases, like Bahawalpur and Muridke , are universities of global terrorism. The big terrorist attacks of the world, be it 9/11, be it London Tube bombings, or the big terrorist attacks which have happened in India in the last many decades, their roots are somehow connected to these terrorist hideouts. The terrorists had wiped out the sindoor of our sisters and India responded by destroying their terrorist headquarters. More than 100 dreaded terrorists have been killed in these attacks by India. Many terrorist leaders were roaming freely in Pakistan for the last two and a half to three decades, who used to conspire against India. India killed them in one stroke.Pakistan was deeply disappointed and frustrated by this action of India. It was bewildered, and in this bewilderment, it did another cowardly act. Instead of supporting India’s strike against terrorism, Pakistan started attacking India itself. Pakistan targeted our schools, colleges, gurdwaras, temples and houses of civilians. Pakistan targeted our military base.But in this act Pakistan itself got exposed. The world saw how Pakistan’s drones and missiles fell like straws in front of India. India’s strong air defence system destroyed them in the sky itself. Pakistan had prepared for an attack on the border, but India struck at the heart of Pakistan. India’s drones and missiles damaged those airbases of the Pakistani air forces, of which Pakistan was very proud. India caused heavy damage to Pakistan in the first three days itself, which it had never imagined.That’s why after India’s aggressive action, Pakistan started looking for ways to escape. Pakistan was pleading to the world to ease tensions. And after suffering heavy losses, Pakistan’s army contacted our DGMO on the afternoon of May 10. By then we had destroyed the infrastructure of terrorism on a large scale. The terrorists were eliminated. We had destroyed the terror camps established in the heart of Pakistan. Therefore, when Pakistan appealed and said that it will not indulge in any sort of terror activities or military audacity further, India considered it. And I am repeating again, we have just suspended our retaliatory action against Pakistan’s terror and military camps. In the coming days we will measure every step of Pakistan on the criterion that what sort of attitude Pakistan will adopt ahead.After the surgical strike and air strike, now Operation Sindoor is India’s policy against terrorism. Operation Sindoor has carved out a new benchmark in our fight against terrorism and has set up a new parameter and new normal.First, if there is a terrorist attack on India, a fitting reply will be given.We will give a befitting response on our terms only. We will take strict action at every place from where the roots of terrorism emerge.Secondly, India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.Thirdly, we will not differentiate between govt sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism. During Operation Sindoor, the world has again seen the ugly face of Pakistan, when top Pakistani army officers came to bid farewell to the slain terrorists. This is strong evidence of state-sponsored terrorism. We will continue to take decisive steps to protect India and our citizens from any threat.We have defeated Pakistan every time on the battlefield. And this time Operation Sindoor has added a new dimension. We have proved our superiority in new age warfare. The credibility of our Made in India weapons was also proven. Today, the world is witnessing that in 21st century warfare, the time has come for Made in India defence equipment.This is certainly not the era of war, but this is also not the era of terrorism. Zero tolerance against terrorism is the guarantee for a better world.The way the Pakistani army, Pakistan govt are encouraging terrorism, it will destroy Pakistan one day. If Pakistan wants to survive, it will have to destroy its terror infrastructure. There is no other way to peace. India’s stand is very clear... Terror and talks cannot go together... Terror and trade cannot go together…. Water and blood cannot flow together.Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stated policy has been: If there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK).Today is Buddha Purnima . Lord Buddha has shown us the path of peace. The path of peace also goes through power. Humanity should move towards peace and prosperity. Every Indian should be able to live in peace and can fulfil the dream of Viksit Bharat. For this, it is very necessary for India to be powerful. And it is also necessary to use this power when required. And in the last few days, India has done just that.","PM Modi: 'Every Indian must be able to live in peace and harmony' 'Every terrorist, every terror organisation knows the consequence of wiping out the Sindoor of our sisters and daughters' 'Operation Sindoor has carved out a new benchmark in our fight against terrorism and has set up a new normal'","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121124553,imgsize-676237,width-400,resizemode-4/article-80.jpg"

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs after his T20 retirement? No, it's time to retire. Yes, he should.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: India’s white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he’s not done just yet, he’s very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time. Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all. That's how I think now.""READ ALSO: 'Bekaar': Rohit Sharma makes shocking statement about naturally-gifted player ""I’ve done it; I’ve scored the runs I was meant to. Now, I want to play cricket in a different way. I’m not taking any of this for granted. Don’t assume that things will just keep going the same way, that I’ll keep scoring 20 or 30 runs and just continue playing. The day I feel like I’m not able to do what I want to do on the field, I’ll stop playing. That’s for sure. But right now, I know that what I’m doing is still helping the team,"" he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit has been a key pillar in India's ODI setup, with 11,168 runs in 273 matches at an impressive average of 48.76. Under his leadership, India clinched the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy earlier this year, further cementing his legacy in white-ball cricket.While he called time on his T20 career after the Barbados final, the 37-year-old recently stepped away from Test cricket after an 11-year career, having played 67 Tests and scored 4,301 runs. His highest Test score, 212, came during a memorable series against South Africa in 2019.While he’s shut the door on red-ball cricket, just like his compatriot Virat Kohli, who hung his Test boots on Monday in an unexpected retirement call, both Kohli and Rohit remain committed to ODIs, for now. Perhaps the pair is keeping an eye on the upcoming 2027 ODI World Cup.Rohit’s message is clear: he’s still hungry, still driven, but when the moment comes to step aside, he’ll do it on his own terms.","India's white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals.

NEW DELHI: The Indian defence establishment was outraged when Pakistan violated the understanding to stop all cross-border military action from 5pm onwards on Saturday by sending another wave of drones across the entire western front later that night.Lt General Ghai had on Sunday declared that India would deliver ""a fierce and punitive response"" if Pakistan violated the bilateral understanding, with Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi granting ""full authority"" to commanders for ""counteraction in the kinetic domain"" to any more misadventures.As for the build-up after the Pahalgam terror massacre, Pakistan has moved several reserve army formations, tanks and Chinese-made SH-15 self-propelled 155mm howitzers closer to the LoC as well as the International Border. India, of course, had also made ""mirror deployments"" of its forces.Sources said the Shakargarh Bulge, which protrudes into India between the Chenab and Ravi rivers, was one of the places where a major build-up of tanks and armoured vehicles by the Pakistan army was spotted.The area's flat terrain and its proximity to Indian cities such as Amritsar, Pathankot, Batala and Gurdaspur as well as road links to Jammu makes it a high priority area for the Indian Army. It was the site of the famous 'Battle of Basantar' during the 1971 war.","India outraged when Pakistan violated understanding to stop cross-border military action.

Indian assets

Future build-up

BENGALURU: Indian armed forces used a wide range of space assets - domestic and international commercial - to carry out Operation Sindoor , multiple sources have confirmed to TOI.“All of our strategic assets were put to use in different ways by our armed forces for Operation Sindoor. Our teams have been working round the clock and we are proud that Isro could help our forces in missions important for the country,” a senior official from Isro told TOI.Another official said that aside from domestic assets directly available with the armed forces (India has 9-11 military satellites ), Isro also facilitated “repeatable” data from a commercial global operator. “While data from our satellites from the Cartosat series and others were also used for planning, images were procured from Maxar ,” the senior official said.Maxar, the US-based satellite imagery provider supplies images to multiple governments and non-government entities across the world, while it remains unclear if Pakistan used its services for any of its operations during the current conflict. It is noteworthy that Pakistan also has access to the extensive military space assets of China.Indian armed forces also have access to other satellite data from Sentinel from Europe and another commercial operator from the US.“Indian satellites provide periodic data - with downloads of specific areas possible about once in 14 days. This data was made use of, while they used commercial data that’s available once a day too,” the official said.The Cartosat family of satellites, with high-resolution imagery and dual-use (image & video) capabilities, has been a key asset in India’s military intelligence toolkit. Launched for the first time in 2005, and progressively upgraded with satellites like the Cartosat-2C (for military), these satellites have provided crucial imagery for operations.Cartosat-2C, for example, delivers images with a resolution of 0.65 metres- an improvement over previous models- and has been vital in reconnaissance and surveillance operations. The high-resolution images from Cartosat can capture areas of interest (AOI) with incredible clarity, enabling commanders to make precise decisions based on intelligence from space. These were used for the 2016 Surgical Strike.Aside from Cartosat, the Risat family of satellites would have provided radar images useful to track movement, while the Gsat family of satellites were used for communications. “In all, a variety of Indian space assets have been useful and efforts are on to increase support to the armed forces in the years to come,” the official said. India’s NavIC combined with other global GPS systems also aided in operations.Indian Space Association (ISpA) director-general Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhat, said: “There would have been extensive use of space assets for imagery, sat-com (satellite communication) and PNT (positioning, navigation and timing). Space technology is an integral part of modern warfare.”Isro chairman V Narayanan, who said Sunday that 10 satellites are working round the clock for the armed forces, did not specifically comment on Operation Sindoor. He, however, told TOI: “We will be launching another important satellite on May 18, the EOS-09 or Risat-1B, which will add teeth to our armed forces.”“The satellite features an advanced C-band synthetic aperture radar system that delivers high-resolution Earth surface imagery in all weather conditions. This capability significantly enhances India’s surveillance capabilities,” he added. Unlike conventional optical satellites limited by cloud cover or darkness, Risat-1B’s radar technology penetrates these obstacles effectively.Earlier this month, Narayanan had said that India would launch 100-150 satellites in the next five years. Among these would be the 52 satellites part of the Space-Based Surveillance-3 (SBS-3) programme. Thirty-one of these will be developed by the private sector.","Indian armed forces used a wide range of space assets - domestic and international commercial - to carry out Operation Sindoor, multiple sources have confirmed to TOI.

They are ready to undertake any future missions should the need arise,’ said Air Marshal Bharti

NEW DELHI: From Turkish drones to Chinese missiles , and possibly even a few Pakistani aircraft, all were thwarted by India's integrated multi-layered air defence network during three days of intense hostilities, top military officers said on Monday.""Our integrated air defence (AD) systems stood like a wall and they (Pakistan) could not breach it. Whether it's a Turkish drone or anything else, it fails in front of the technology of India,"" director general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti said.""The sky remains ours,"" with a relatively impregnable AD shield, was the underlying message of the briefing he addressed with his Army and Navy counterparts, Lt-General Rajiv Ghai and Vice Admiral A N Pramod, on Monday.""All our military bases, all our systems continue to remain fully operational. They are ready to undertake any future missions should the need arise,"" Air Marshal Bharti added.The officers showed evidentiary photos of Pakistan having used Chinese-made PL-15 LR beyond visual range air-to-air missiles as well as Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze and Asisguard Songar drones, apart from long-range rockets, loiter munitions and quadcopters.Most of them were shot down by India's AD systems, while the ones that got through caused only minimal damage. ""Whenever Pakistan Air Force attacked us, it failed in front of our AD grid,"" Lt-Gen Ghai said.As reported by TOI earlier, the AD network of surveillance and target-acquisition radars and a wide array of weapon systems are all plugged into the integrated air command and control system (IACCS) of the IAF and the Akashteer system to provide a composite real-time air picture to the armed forces.The network stretches from the long-range Russian S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile systems (380-km interception range) and Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70-km), jointly developed with Israel, to the shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles (6-km) and the indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (1-2 km).The indigenous Akash system, which is capable of intercepting hostile aircraft, helicopters and drones at a range of 25-km, falls in between. ""Another highlight has been the stellar performance of indigenous AD weapons like Akash,"" Air Marshal Bharti said.The IAF, as reported by TOI earlier, has inducted the bulk of the 15 squadrons of Akash-1 and 2 systems it has ordered for Rs 10,900 crore. The Army, in turn, has four Akash regiments worth Rs 22,340 crore, with more in the pipeline. A new-generation Akash weapon system, with an interception range of 30-km, is also now ready for the final trials.The senior IAF officer also praised the ""performance and efficacy"" demonstrated by even older AD systems like the Pechora missiles, OSA-AK-m (10-km) and low-level L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5-km) in countering the ""Pakistani threat vectors"".Of the 300 to 400 drones launched by Pakistan across the entire western front on May 8, for instance, 50 were destroyed by L-70 and ZU-23mm twin-barrel guns and other such weapons.Another 20 drones were jammed and spoofed by a variety of devices, while the rest flew back across the border. At the other end of the spectrum, a Pakistani high-speed missile was intercepted over Sirsa by an advanced AD missile system on May 10.Though the Navy's formidable ""fleet air defence mechanism"" did not come into play in the northern Arabian Sea, Vice Admiral Pramod said the presence of aircraft carrier INS Vikrant battlegroup, with MiG-29K fighters and early-warning helicopters, compelled the Pakistan Air Force to remain ""bottled-up"" close to the Makran coast.","The officers showed evidentiary photos of Pakistan having used Chinese-made PL-15 LR beyond visual range air-to-air missiles as well as Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze and Asisguard Songar drones.

"Operation Sindoor: My eyes welled up when it worked so well, says the man behind Akash",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/my-eyes-welled-up-when-it-worked-so-well-says-the-man-behind-akash-defence-system/articleshow/121121403.cms,"Akash missile system key in repelling Pakistani drone attacks along LoC, said officials (ANI)

NEW DELHI: It took 15 years, a thousand scientists and combined effort of several defence labs situated across the country to develop the indigenous Akash missile defence system that successfully passed its first battlefield test along the western borders with Pakistan, said a proud Prahlada Ramarao , the then project director of the totally-indigenous missile shield programme of Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ).The Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from Pakistan during the night of May 8 and 9. Indian military officials have confirmed the effectiveness of India’s missile defence systems like Akash and S400 Triumf when IAF DGMO Air Marshal AK Bharti on Monday asserted that India’s defence systems “stood like a wall”, preventing enemy breaches.On Akash clearing its first ‘agni-pariksha’ and boosting India’s ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence production, Ramarao, a Padma Shri recipient, told TOI, “My eyes welled up when my baby worked so well. It is the happiest day of my life. This is bigger than my Padma award.”Ramarao was handpicked by India’s ‘Missile Man’ Dr APJ Abdul Kalam as the youngest project director at the age of 35 to head the Akash programme in early 1990s. Kalam was then head of DRDO’s defence laboratory Defence Research Laboratory (DRL) in Hyderabad, before he became scientific adviser to the defence minister and subsequently the President of India. “A leader brings team spirit and inspires all to work towards a common goal. Kalam was a true leader in that sense. The country now requires 10 Abdul Kalams to grow and develop in various fields like the way the aerospace and defence sectors grew under him,” he said.Though Akash had undergone numerous test trials and later user trials by the Army and IAF, this was the first time the missile defence witnessed a real battlefield condition when Pakistan attacked India with missiles and drones. Both Indian Army and IAF have strategically deployed this missile system alongside the western border as Akash has the capability to neutralise aerial targets like fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles and even drones. The real time multi-sensor data processing and threat evaluation enables simultaneous engagement of multiple targets from any direction.“We started work on this project in 1994 with an initial budget of Rs 300 crore. When you invent something, you fail several times. We also failed. But we learnt from our mistakes. Developing Rajendra, a complex multi-function electronically scanned phased array radar, was the biggest challenge. But we overcame that challenge after several hits and trials. Later, the project budget was raised to Rs 500 crore,” Ramarao said.“I guarantee you, nowhere in the world a missile defence system could have been invented in just Rs 500 crore. Our Akash is the cheapest but most effective missile shield. It can detect a hostile missile from a distance of 70km and kill it at a 30km range,” the DRDO veteran, now 78 years old, said.After its development in 2009, Akash has since undergone continuous evolution, resulting in the development of several variants, each with enhanced capabilities tailored to address specific operational requirements. These variants include initial Mark-I, upgraded Akash-1S with an indigenous seeker, high-accuracy Akash Prime designed for high-altitude and low-temperature operations, and advanced next-generation Akash-NG, which boasts significantly extended range and sophisticated features.As per an estimate, IAF has inducted a substantial number of Akash systems, with reports indicating the induction of 15 squadrons. Army operates four regiments of Aakash, with plans for further acquisitions to augment its air defence capabilities.Impressed with its efficient working, Armenia became the first country to ink a deal with India in 2022 to procure 15 Akash missile systems worth around Rs 6,000 crore. Last year, India had dispatched the first batch of the missile systems to the central Asian country to protect its borders.","The Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from Pakistan during the night of May 8 and 9.

On Saturday, my administration helped broker a full and immediate ceasefire - I think a permanent one - between India and Pakistan, ending a dangerous conflict between two nations with lots of nuclear weapons,"" he said Monday.Minutes later, PM Modi asserted that India had only agreed to pause ' Operation Sindoor ' and that Pakistan will continue to be under watch, suggesting that all bets will be off if Islamabad did not stop its support to terrorism He also made it clear that Pakistan's nuclear blackmail - something which India believes that the US and the West in general have consistently indulged - is not going to deter India from acting against terrorists operating under the cover of the assumption that Pakistan's generals may unleash their nukes to save groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e Muhammad.Modi made it clear that India will discuss only terrorism and POK with Pakistan - a condition that Islamabad is unlikely to accept, at least in the near future.Trump had claimed that he had used trade as the lever for getting India and Pakistan on the negotiating table. ""Come on, we are going to do a lot of trade with you guys, so let's stop it. People have never really used trade the way I use it. Then all of a sudden they said - let's stop,"" he had first said in the context that the US was going to trade more with both countries.The assertion was not only refuted by official sources that US V-P J D Vance had brought up the trade issue when he called the PM on Friday, it also appeared to be running afoul of Modi's assertion to let his ""tough on terror"" stand be encumbered by any consideration, trade including.In his address, Modi reiterated that trade and terror cannot go together. While he had first articulated it in the context of Pakistan, on Monday its scope appeared to extend to the US president's claim.","PM Modi refutes US President Donald Trump's claim that his administration was instrumental in getting India and Pakistan to suspend hostilities and agree to start comprehensive negotiations for peace.

NEW DELHI: India did not strike Kirana Hills in Pakistan’s Punjab province, a fortified complex with underground nuclear infrastructure and storage facilities, though some strategic messaging was certainly done by hitting the Nur Khan and Sargodha airbases.IAF fighter jets like Sukhoi-30MKIs, armed with BrahMos missiles and other weapons, did target nine airbases in Pakistan and PoK as well as some radar sites, but Kirana Hills wasn’t among the targets.On whether IAF hit Kirana Hills nuclear storage facility, director general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti first said in a lighter vein, “Thank you for telling us Kirana Hills houses nuclear installations. We did not know it.”IAF's categorical denial that it had bombed Kirana Hills in Pakistan's Punjab province effectively junks reports of "" radioactive leakage "" at the site due to a missile hit, which had found some traction in international circles.""We have not hit Kirana Hills, whatever is there. I did not brief about it in my briefing on Operation Sindoor yesterday,"" Air Marshal A K Bharti said at the tri-services presser on Monday.IAF, of course, did hit the Sargodha airbase , which is home to F-16 and JF-17 fighters, and just around 20km from Kirana Hills. The hills are around 75km away from Pakistan's crucial Khushab nuclear complex , which has four heavy water reactors to produce weapons-grade plutonium.Another big hit took place at the Nur Khan-Chaklala airbase at Rawalpindi, located close to the headquarters of Pakistan's Strategic Plans Division, which handles Pak's N-arsenal like the Indian Strategic Forces Command, and is barely 10km from Islamabad.

Poll Do you believe the Chinese military's denial of sending arms to Pakistan? No, I think there's more to the story. Yes, I believe their statement.

Chinese military on Monday addressed the reports claiming that it sent its largest military cargo plane with arms supplies to Pakistan during its offensive against India last week. The People's Liberation Army Air Force called it a ""rumour"" and warned of legal action against those behind this.In a statement published on the official website of the Chinese defence ministry, the Air Force clarified that no such mission had taken place, countering the speculation circulating across various internet platforms about China's ""Y-20 transporting relief supplies to Pakistan"".""The internet is not beyond the law! Those who produce and spread military-related rumours will be held legally responsible!"" the report added.This came after Beijing rejected claims by Pakistan that it used Chinese fighter jets against India during Operation Sindoor . It had also stressed upon its anti-terrorism stance saying, ""China opposes all forms of terrorism. We urge both sides to act in the larger interest of peace and stability, remain calm, exercise restraint, and refrain from taking actions that may further complicate the situation.""The reports of China helping Pakistan received fuel after it expressed support for its ""all-weather friend"" during Operation Sindoor.Meanwhile, China has become the primary arms supplier to Pakistan, accounting for a staggering 81% of Islamabad’s total weapons imports between 2020 and 2024, according to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).Operation Sindoor, launched in response to Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 25 Indian nationals and one Nepalese citizen, has seen the Indian Armed Forces carry out a series of precision strikes deep inside Pakistan.According to official statements, nine terror camps across Pakistan were targeted during the midnight operation, as part of a broader retaliation aimed at dismantling infrastructure supporting cross-border terrorism.","Chinese military denied sending arms to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.

NEW DELHI: Pakistani drones breached Indian airspace over border regions of J&K, Rajasthan and Punjab late Monday, triggering blackouts and emergency measures, despite a pause in Indo-Pak military action.Drones were spotted near Samba sector in Jammu division, shortly after PM Narendra Modi praised Indian forces for the success of Operation Sindoor and warned Islamabad over terrorist links.Red streaks and explosions lit the sky, according to residents. Army sources confirmed drone movement, saying: ""Being engaged. There is no need to be alarmed."" No further intrusions were reported, suggesting air defences neutralised the threat.Suspicious drone-like objects were reported over Rajasthan's Jhunjhunu district around 9.30pm. Blackouts were ordered across Chirawa, Surajgarh, Sultana, and Pilani.

While no official red alert was issued, Jaisalmer saw an undeclared blackout with street lighting suspended. Drone activity was concentrated in Jalipa, Munabao Gadra sector, Mohangarh, and Shahgarh.Punjab enforced precautionary blackouts in multiple border districts Monday night. In Jalandhar, a surveillance drone was brought down near Mand village at 9.20pm, according to DC Himanshu Aggarwal. Drone incursions ceased by 10pm, but partial blackouts were ordered in parts of Jalandhar near Suranassi.""As a precautionary measure, lights have been switched off in some areas around Suranassi as there have been reports of drone sightings.

NEW DELHI: In a hard-hitting speech that clearly signalled a paradigm shift, PM Narendra Modi on Monday evening unveiled India's new doctrine towards Pakistan-backed terror , saying India would give a fitting reply to future attacks, which will not be constrained by geography or Islamabad's 'nuclear blackmail'. India would no longer differentiate between terror masterminds and their state sponsors, he added in no uncertain terms, doing away with a vital distinction that had been made till now.Addressing the nation, PM Modi made it clear that Operation Sindoor has only been suspended and India could resume military action if Pakistan does not abide by the commitments it made to get India to agree to the pause. ""In the coming days, we will measure every step of Pakistan on the criterion of what sort of attitude Pakistan will adopt ahead,"" the PM said.""Now, Operation Sindoor is India's policy against terrorism.

NEW DELHI: Max Haot , chief executive officer of US-based company Vast , which is planning to launch the world’s first commercial space station , has evinced interest in using Indian rockets to transport crew members to its upcoming orbital laboratory.In an interview to, Haot, who recently visited India to attend an international space conference GLEX-2025, said, “There is a possibility of using Gaganyaan rockets as a transport service for our space station.”The space-habitation company, which has 750+ team members, is in the race to build a space station called Haven-2 that will be the successor to the International Space Station, which will be retired by 2031.The CEO said, “We want to work with all nations that are engaged in human spaceflight missions and see that India is about to be a leader in human spaceflight, which is really a great thing. We look forward to collaborating with India. We are open to many levels of collaboration. In space stations, we are open to technology exchange within the confines of the export control (regime).”Haot said, “We are very impressed with Isro and the Indian govt in achieving new capabilities, especially in regard to their upcoming Gaganyaan programme and Axiom-4 mission to the ISS that will make India the fourth country in the world to achieve the capability to send an astronaut to space.”Before Haven-2, the California-based company plans to launch Haven-1, a single-module space station, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in May 2026. The Haven-1 spacecraft has a 45-metre-cubed volume and is designed to support up to four crew members for missions of an average of two weeks in length.The first module of Haven-2, a much larger space station, is expected to be launched in 2028. Vast is planning to have the first operational module in 2028 and a fully built and functional space station in 2032. This will be designed for both govt and commercial use. It will have nine modules, 500 cubic metre of habitable volume and 86KW of total power. “We are seeking Nasa aid for the Haven-2 project, which will be managed by VAST. Once operational, this commercial space station will be open to all.”Isro is going to launch its crewed Gaganyaan mission in 2027 and if the mission is successful, more such crewed missions will be launched to space. Though India is making its own Bharatiya Antariksh Station, the collaboration with VAST for its commercial space station is likely to be beneficial to India as Isro will gain from the company’s expertise in setting up a space station.","The space-habitation company, which has 750+ team members, is in the race to build a space station called Haven-2 that will be the successor to the International Space Station.

NEW DELHI: In a strong message to Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi urged it to demolish ""terror universities"" for its own survival. ""The way the Pakistani army and Pakistan government are encouraging terrorism, it will destroy Pakistan one day. If Pakistan wants to survive, it will have to destroy its terror infrastructure,"" he said.Detailing the success of India's military offensive under Operation Sindoor , PM Modi said that Pakistan proved to be no match to the bravery, courage and capabilities of Indian forces. He also faulted Pakistan for attacking India instead of taking action against terrorists. ""Pakistan targeted our schools, colleges, gurudwaras, temples and houses of civilians. Pakistan targeted our military base but in this act, Pakistan itself got exposed. The world saw how Pakistan's drones and missiles fell like straws in front of India. India's strong air defence system destroyed them in the sky itself. Pakistan had prepared for an attack on the border, but India struck at the heart of Pakistan. India's drones and missiles attacked with precision. They damaged those air bases of the Pakistani air force, of which Pakistan was very proud.""He said that while India has defeated Pakistan in all battles, the success of Operation Sindoor was significant because it established the country's ""superiority in New Age warfare and the capability of Made-in-India weapons.In his address to the nation, Modi also made it clear that India would not brook any attempt at international mediation and any effort to put J&K back on the negotiation table. ""Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stand has been - if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir ,"" in what sounded like a message aimed at US president Donald Trump, who on Monday spoke of his interest in brokering a ""permanent"" ceasefire between India and Pakistan.The 22-minute-long address, which was broadcast in 10 languages, drastically lowered the threshold for a military retaliation against acts of terrorism by groups based in and supported by Pakistan, while setting tougher standards for judging Pakistan's compliance with India's insistence that it take action against terrorists. Laying out the new benchmarks, PM Modi said: ""First, if there is a terrorist attack on India, a fitting reply will be given. Secondly, India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail. Thirdly, we will not differentiate between the government-sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism. During Operation Sindoor the world has again seen the ugly face of Pakistan, when top Pakistani officers came to bid farewell to terrorists. This is strong evidence of state-sponsored terrorism. We will continue to take decisive steps to protect India and our citizens from any threat.""PM Modi said that Operation Sindoor became a necessity because of the barbarity of the terrorists who killed 26 civilians in Pahalgam. ""The merciless killing of innocent citizens in front of their families and their children on the basis of their religion was a very gruesome face of terror and cruelty. This was also a disgusting attempt to harm our unity and integrity,"" Modi said. He added that the slaughter, which shocked the entire country and the world, was ""very painful for him"".","PM Narendra Modi urges Pakistan to demolish ""terror universities"" for its own survival.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: Schools and colleges in J&K will reopen Tuesday but those in border areas will remain closed for now as a precautionary measure, authorities said Monday amid early signs of a return to normality following the pause in hostilities with Pakistan.Separately, official sources said civilian flights from Srinagar airport will resume from Tuesday after remaining cancelled for almost a week since the launch of Operation Sindoor against Pakistan on May 7. Haj flights from Srinagar will resume on Wednesday.While the return to normal life came as a relief for most, chief minister Omar Abdullah offered a reality check. “May we never face such a situation again. But if we do, we must be better prepared,” Omar said after reviewing damage from Pakistani attacks in Jammu.On schools in heavily shelled and vulnerable border zones, J&K education minister Sakina Itoo revealed that the govt would arrive at a decision on Tuesday. Jammu divisional commissioner Jammu confirmed the partial resumption, saying this was decided by the Union Territory’s education department “after reviewing the situation” following the halt in the conflict.A massive clearance operation continued in border areas. On Monday, police allowed residents of Kamalkote, Gowhallan, Madha, Salamabad, Gangerhill, and Gawalta villages in Uri sector of north Kashmir’s Baramulla to return to their homes after clearing these hamlets of unexploded ordnances.On Monday, the Army disclosed that border areas experienced their first night of calm, with no cross-border shelling reported anywhere. “The night remained largely peaceful across J&K and other areas along the border,” an Army statement said.In Jammu, CM Omar signalled the challenges ahead. “For the first time, even old quarters of Jammu have been affected. We are now forced to contemplate building bunkers in the city —something previously unimaginable,” Omar said, highlighting the expanding threat of cross-border shelling.Omar stressed the need for immediate reforms in preparedness for such conflicts. His statements followed an extensive tour to assess the ground situation in the aftermath of the recent cross-border shelling in Poonch, among the worst-affected districts in cross-border shelling that resulted in the loss of 13 lives and injuries to many others.“We must learn from this experience and rectify our shortcomings. Strengthening hospital infrastructure is essential. We plan to establish critical infrastructure including fixed and mobile bunkers, reinforce ambulance services, and improve evacuation mechanisms in border areas through mock drills and practical assessments,” Omar said.",Schools and colleges in J&K will reopen Tuesday but those in border areas will remain closed for now as a precautionary measure.

NEW DELHI: A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of HC judge Yashwant Varma on March 14 night, in its report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.The inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC’s Justice Anu Sivaraman recorded the statements of the judge’s private secretary and staff, security personnel posted at his residence as well as fire and police personnel on the fire incident at the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow, the official residence of then Delhi HC judge Varma.All personnel among the first responders were unequivocal that they made videos of burning cash as well as sacks of cash untouched by the leaping flames of the fire that broke out at the storeroom within the judge’s residential premises and left the place without seizing any of the cash, either burnt or unburnt.Delhi HC Chief Justice D K Upadhyay, on being informed about the incident by the Delhi Police commissioner at 4.50pm on March 15, had instructed his registrar-cum-secretary to visit Justice Varma’s residence and inspect the place of fire. On reaching the residence, he was taken to Justice Varma by the latter’s private secretary.Justice Varma took the CJ’s secretary to the room, which was adjacent to the judge’s official residence. He found that though burnt articles and debris were in the room, there was no sign of any cash, burnt or unburnt.The inquiry panel recorded that the fire service was alerted by police, who got the first call about the incident at the judge’s residence at 11.35pm on March 14.They reached the spot at 11.43pm, doused the fire and left the scene at 1.56am on March 15. The panel also found that shortly thereafter police personnel, who videographed the incident, also left the house, leaving behind the cash as it were in the room. Security personnel posted at the judge’s residence informed the panel that Justice Varma’s private secretary and personal staff stayed back. The panel said it is prima facie of the opinion that the cash disappeared from the room in the early hours of March 15 and that the fire scene was cleared of all burnt and unburnt notes, which could not have been done without the knowledge and involvement of the judge’s private secretary and personal staff.However, the panel said it would require a formal investigation to summon witnesses and record their statements, which cannot be done by the informal inquiry panel as it had not been conferred with powers to probe as per the criminal procedure code. It is to be seen whether Delhi HC initiates any disciplinary proceedings against the judge’s private secretary based on the inquiry panel’s prima facie findings.CJI Khanna had forwarded the inquiry report to Justice Varma seeking his response and with a suggestion that he should quit judgeship. Justice Varma refused to quit, forcing the CJI to send the inquiry report along with the judge’s response to the President and the PM for formal initiation of a removal motion against him.Justice Varma was repatriated from Delhi HC to Allahabad HC, his parent high court, immediately after the constitution of the inquiry panel and has been stripped of judicial work.","A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of HC judge Yashwant Varma on March 14 night, has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash. All personnel among the first responders were unequivocal that they made videos of burning cash as well as sacks of cash untouched by the leaping flames of the fire.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121092433,imgsize-375862,width-400,resizemode-4/article-24.jpg"
'Petty attempt to divide us politically deplorable': Shashi Tharoor slams BJP for listing terror attacks during UPA years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/petty-attempt-to-divide-us-politically-deplorable-shashi-tharoor-slams-bjp-for-listing-terror-attacks-during-upa-years/articleshow/121057547.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party for invoking a political flavour to the India-Pakistan tensions by listing out the number of terror attacks that took place during UPA years. This came even as the opposition party has offered its support to the government in its efforts against terrorism after the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people on April 22.""At a time when the nation stands united as Indians, this petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable. Our government has learned the futility of past approaches the hard way -- after inviting Pakistan to participate in the investigation of the Pathankot blasts in 2016. It is only then that it took to the path of military action, carefully calibrated and maturely conducted. This advertisement is neither appropriate nor mature. Delete it, please, @BJP4India,"" Tharoor said in a post on X. BJP posted a video on X criticising the UPA regime for its ""passivity"" and calling it out on its ""futile peace talks"" with Pakistan.""The message to the enemies is loud and clear. Don't mess with us! Unlike the UPA regime’s passivity, New India has no patience for futile peace talks,"" it said.Tharoor's reaction comes at a time when his appreciation for the Modi-government in certain foreign policies made headlines fueling rumours of rift with the grand old party. BJP leader Amit Malviya even took a jibe at him calling him PM Modi's fan after he sided with the current government's stance on Russia-Ukraine policy. ""Prime Minister Modi needs new haters… Old ones are turning into his fans,"" Malviya had said.Additionally, his presence at Vizhinjam port inauguration and sharing stage with PM Modi gained attention after the prime minister said that the event would give ""sleepless nights to several people"" taking a jibe at INDIA bloc.However, BJP leader CR Kesavan criticised Congress saying, ""We salute the exemplary courage and unparalleled commitment of our brave armed forces in decisively defeating the cowardly attacks of Pakistan on Bharat and our civilians...But unfortunately, the poisonous political propaganda of the Congress Party and their noxious fake narratives have now been weaponised by the enemy state of Pakistan...After Operation Sindoor commenced, Udit Raj of the Congress Party gave the name Operation Sindoor a communal colour. So the Congress Party is failing the nation again and again. It's high time they stop politicising the army and stop their fake factory of false narratives...""Meanwhile, India and Pakistan have agreed to stop the military action against each other with the former categorically maintaining ""a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations"".""India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action. India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,"" external affairs minister S Jaishankar said.","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party for invoking a political flavour to the India-Pakistan tensions.

"Pakistan concedes Indian missile strikes destroyed Rahim Yar Khan airbase; killed Squadron leader, 4 others in Sindh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-concedes-indian-missile-strikes-destroyed-rahim-yar-khan-airbase-killed-squadron-leader-4-others-in-sindh/articleshow/121088302.cms,"Representative image

ISLAMABAD: A Squadron Leader was among five Pakistan Air Force (PAF) personnel killed at Bholari in Sindh while the Rahim Yar Khan airbase housed within the international airport of the same name in Punjab province suffered massive damage in coordinated Indian missile strikes targeting the country’s air defence infrastructure, authorities confirmed Sunday after taking stock of the impact of India’s “retaliatory” action early on May 10.The missile fired at Rahim Yar Khan airbase caused a massive crater on the portion of the runway, the district deputy commissioner said.Sources acknowledged that the attack in the dead of night had been timed to avoid civilian casualties. Although passenger flights to and from the airport have since resumed, the missile strike has severely limited the military operations from the airbase.Pakistani officials emphasise Rahim Yar Khan’s strategic role in southern air defences, close to India’s Rajasthan border. They contested India’s statement that a wave of drones launched from the airbase to attack border villages invited the strong missile retaliation.The PAF casualties at Base Bholari in Sindh’s Jamshoro district included Sq Ldr Usman Yousaf and four others in uniform. The base supports F-16 and JF-17 fighter jets, critical to Pakistan’s southern air operations. Pakistani authorities didn’t specify the material losses. Indian media reports, unverified by Pakistan, suggest damage to aircraft and infrastructure.Pakistani officials also confirmed simultaneous attacks on Nur Khan airbase at Chaklala in Rawalpindi, Rafiqui airbase at Shorkot in Punjab), Murid airbase in Chakwal and Chunian airbase in Punjab. They mentioned damage to transport aircraft at Nur Khan and technical facilities at Chunian.India officially named eight PAF bases, including radar sites in Pasrur and Sialkot. Pakistan’s “Operation Bunyan-ul-Marsoos” targeting Indian sites didn’t cause significant damage, the Indian military said in its first official presser since a pause in military operations.","A Squadron Leader was among five Pakistan Air Force (PAF) personnel killed at Bholari in Sindh.

Beware of unofficial portals

Steps to check CBSE results securely

Digital infrastructure and next steps

As the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) gears up to release the Class 10 and Class 12 board exam results for 2025, students and parents are urged to rely only on official platforms to access authentic marksheets. With over 42 lakh students registered across both classes this year, the digital traffic on result day is expected to be intense. This often leads to confusion between legitimate websites and unofficial portals that may mislead or delay access.In 2025, CBSE continues its strong collaboration with the Ministry of Electronics and IT to ensure smooth, secure, and timely access to digital marksheets via verified platforms. However, several unofficial websites tend to surface during result season, mimicking official interfaces and collecting personal data unnecessarily. It is crucial to distinguish between trusted portals and those that are unauthorised.CBSE has officially confirmed the following websites and digital platforms for result access:These portals have been integrated with CBSE’s evaluation system and provide access to digitally signed provisional marksheets, which are legally valid for admissions and employment.Students are cautioned against using third-party websites that are not linked to CBSE or government services. While some private education portals may redirect to the official pages, others might display outdated information or request unnecessary login details. CBSE has not authorised any private portal to host the results directly.Unofficial websites may include pop-up ads, incorrect links, or misleading graphics resembling official CBSE pages. Students are advised to cross-verify the URL and ensure it ends in "".gov.in"" or belongs to DigiLocker/UMANG, both of which are government-run.To check the Class 10 or 12 result safely, students should:Step : Visit results.cbse.nic.in or cbse.gov.in.Step : Click on the relevant link for Class 10 or Class 12 results.Step : Enter the roll number, school number, date of birth, and admit card ID.Step : Submit the details to view the result.Step : Download or print the provisional marksheet.Step : Alternatively, log into DigiLocker using the 6-digit PIN provided by the school to access certificates.Students are also encouraged to set up their DigiLocker accounts in advance, as the portal already shows the “Result Available Soon” message.CBSE’s reliance on digital platforms like DigiLocker and UMANG ensures minimal disruption even during peak traffic. These platforms have built-in encryption and load-balancing systems to handle millions of users simultaneously. Once the results are announced, students must collect their original marksheets from their respective schools.In conclusion, while the pressure of board results can be overwhelming, verifying the platform before checking the result can save time and prevent misuse of personal data. Always trust the official sources for accurate and timely updates.","The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) gears up to release the Class 10 and Class 12 board exam results for 2025.

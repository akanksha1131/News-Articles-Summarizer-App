‘It is laughable’: Maulana Rashidi reacts to RSS chief's 'Hindu rastra' call; terms it vote bank politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-is-laughable-maulana-rashidi-reacts-to-rss-chiefs-hindu-rastra-call-terms-it-vote-bank-politics/articleshow/126132191.cms,"NEW DELHI: All India Imam Association president Maulana Sajid Rashidi on Monday criticised RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat ’s remarks on India being a Hindu Rashtra, saying the idea went against the Constitution and the country’s democratic character.Responding to Bhagwat’s statement that India is a Hindu Rashtra and that the Constitution’s preamble reflects this., Rashidi said, ""...He does not know that a Hindu rashtra can only be a slogan. Those who are singing the praises of the Hindu nation want to crush the constitution. India is not of one religion but of 140 crore residents. If there is a Hindu kingdom, then the constitution of India will die. We see that all the Islamic countries, where the principles of the Quran are followed, are not democratic countries. It has become a religious country..""Reacting to Bhagwat’s view that the culture of the majority should be respected and not opposed, Rashidi questioned how can Hindus who are in majority be threatened terming the assertion “laughable.”“In Dubai there are 8 per cent Hindu, 5 per cent Hindu in Oman, 15 per cent in Saudi Arabia they are all safe. Here you’ve 80 per cent Hindus; majority and they are not safe? It is laughable, and you’re saying that in a country where from PM to peon is a Hindu.All the judges are Hindu, IAS, IPS are Hindu and still the 80 per cent Hindus are in danger,” he added.He alleged that fanning insecurity among the majority community was politically motivated and purely oriented for vote bank politics.“Telling Hindus that they are in danger is just the politics of the vote bank, it has nothing to do with the constitution,” he said, adding, “I believe that RSS is a big organisation. Its leaders should talk very thoughtfully. The contradictions in his remarks are glaring,” he said.Rashidi further also referred to Bhagwat’s earlier comments acknowledging the historical and continuing presence of Muslims in India, and then contradicting them saying, he is the chief of a big organisation like RSS he should make comments after thorough thinking. “On one hand he says there is no India without Muslims. Muslims were always there, are and will always be, then he says everybody living here is a Hindu, they don’t consider them Muslims . ..”Warning of constitutional consequences, if India were to be a Hindu rastra he said, “The day this country becomes a Hindu rashtra, that day the constitution will be over, then Manusmriti will be implemented and then whatever is told in it will happen with Dalits and other religions ...”Earlier on Sunday Mohan Bhagwat speaking at Kolkata Vyakhyanmala, a session to celebrate the centenary of RSS, said seeing RSS through the lens of BJP is a big mistake.He further added, ""There are people who spread wrong narratives about the Sangh. Interpretation of the Sangh should be objective and not through secondary sources. The goal of the Sangh is organisation of the entire Hindu society, but it is not aimed at opposing others...If you see that Sangh is anti-Muslim, you can make (that) your opinion. But change your opinion if you don't find that.""",All India Imam Association president Maulana Sajid Rashidi criticised RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat ’s remarks on India being a Hindu Rashtra.

(With inputs from agencies)

Ties between India and Bangladesh have hit another roadblock after the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka sparked anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising in Bangladesh, was killed amid rising political tensions, triggering widespread unrest. Bangladesh government suspended visa services in India following protests outside Bangladeshi missions.Protests also erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu man lynched in Mymensingh. Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a demonstration outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday. Protesters described the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.Speakers said Dipu Das, a factory worker recently promoted for his dedication, was falsely accused of religious defamation before being brutally killed.India, meanwhile, has raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions, and what it describes as misleading narratives emerging from Bangladesh.Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.Yunus used the call to reiterate his pledge to hold general elections on February 12, saying the country was “eagerly waiting” to reclaim voting rights allegedly denied under the previous regime.Sharing the details of the conversation, US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said during the call Gor discussed the ""recent events"" in Bangladesh.""Today, Special Envoy for SCA Ambassador Sergio Gor held a productive call with Chief Advisor Yunus @ChiefAdviserGoB to discuss recent events in Bangladesh and shared US interests to advance prosperity through trade,"" US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs wrote on X.Amid mounting protests, Bangladesh suspended visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi and missions in Tripura and Siliguri, citing unavoidable circumstances. The decision followed demonstrations outside Bangladeshi diplomatic premises, while India had earlier suspended visa services at its Chittagong mission after protesters attempted to storm the compound.Yunus insisted the interim government remained committed to delivering a “free, fair and peaceful” election within roughly 50 days, describing the vote as an opportunity to restore democratic legitimacy. At the same time, he warned that supporters of the ousted Awami League regime were allegedly spending millions to disrupt the electoral process, with a fugitive leader inciting violence from abroad.Inqilab Moncho, the platform Hadi led, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding justice, warning that failure to act would trigger a mass movement to oust the interim government. The group demanded a speedy trial tribunal, involvement of international agencies like the FBI and Scotland Yard, and accountability from home and law advisers. Its leaders accused intelligence agencies of failing to identify perpetrators and alleged Awami collaborators were embedded within security structures.Concerns deepened after another leader of the student-led uprising, Motaleb Shikder, was shot in the head in Khulna days after Hadi’s death. Police launched a manhunt but said they remained unclear about the motive or perpetrators. The attack reinforced fears that a coordinated campaign of violence was targeting figures linked to last year’s protests. With multiple leaders injured or killed, questions grew over whether the interim government could guarantee safety during the election period.Earlier on Wednesday, India had summoned Bangladesh’s envoy and expressed strong concern over extremist elements threatening diplomatic missions and minority communities. On December 21, the ministry of external affairs rejected what it called false narratives suggesting security breaches at Bangladesh’s High Commission in Delhi, insisting protests were brief and controlled. New Delhi urged Dhaka to bring perpetrators of the lynching of Hindu man Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained vigilant over minority safety.Bangladesh’s interim government said that it may review the scale of its diplomatic presence in New Delhi if the situation continues to worsen. Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain's remarks came hours after India dismissed Bangladeshi media reports on protests outside the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”.“Regarding the Indian press note, we completely reject it, entirely reject it. The issue has been presented as if it were very simple, whereas in reality it is not,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted Hossain as saying at the media briefing.From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed Yunus entirely for Bangladesh’s instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities, and undermining relations with India. She warned that lawlessness under Yunus had damaged Bangladesh’s credibility and endangered regional stability. Hasina claimed radical groups were exploiting Yunus to reshape foreign policy without a mandate, insisting that ties with India would normalise only after legitimate governance was restored. Her remarks added a powerful external voice to an already volatile political landscape.The assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi, shot at close range in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area and later dying in Singapore, became the catalyst for widespread protests. A key figure in the 'July uprising' that toppled Sheikh Hasina, Hadi’s death sparked anger among supporters who accused the state of inaction. Demonstrations erupted across Dhaka, with calls for accountability growing louder as Yunus declared a national day of mourning. The killing also fuelled fears that political violence was returning just weeks before a pivotal election.The unrest soon spread to Bangladesh’s media houses, with violent mobs attacking the offices of Prothom Alo, The Daily Star, and other outlets in Dhaka. Prothom Alo was forced to halt print publication for the first time in its 27-year history. Yunus condemned the attacks, calling them assaults on truth and press freedom, and pledged full justice. Authorities later said 31 suspects had been identified through video footage, with several arrests made, but the damage to Bangladesh’s democratic image was already significant.","Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.

Ex-CM Baghel's son got Rs 250 crore as his share from Chhattisgarh liquor 'scam': Chargesheet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-cm-baghels-son-got-rs-250-crore-as-his-share-from-chhattisgarh-liquor-scam-chargesheet/articleshow/126132442.cms,"RAIPUR: Chaitanya, son of former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel , received Rs 200 crore to Rs 250 crore as his share from an alleged liquor scam in the state, the Anti-Corruption Bureau/Economic Offence Wing (ACB/EOW) has claimed in its chargesheet.The state police's ACB/EOW, in its seventh supplementary chargesheet in the multi-crore liquor scam filed before a special court here on Monday, claimed Chaitanya Baghel played a key role in establishing, coordinating, and protecting an extortion racket (syndicate) within the excise department (during the previous Congress government, which was in office from 2018-23).The voluminous document, running into around 3,800 pages, has named Chaitnaya Baghel as an accused in the alleged scam pegged at more than Rs 3,000 crore, an ACB/EOW statement said.With this, a total of eight chargesheets have been filed in the case so far.The latest chargesheet details the current status of the investigation against the arrested accused, along with digital evidence reports about all those in custody. The document also outlines the progress of the ongoing probe against the accused persons.The statement quoting the chargesheet said Chaitanya Baghel acted as coordinator among officials such as Anil Tuteja, Soumya Chaurasia, Arunpati Tripathi, and Niranjan Das, who worked in line with the syndicate's interests at the administrative level and as ground-level operatives of the network, such as Anwar Dhebar, Arvind Singh, and Vikas Agarwal (all co-accused), and issued instructions to them.Chaitanya Baghel worked through his trusted associates to transfer and manage proceeds of the scam collected by businessman Anwar Dhebar's team, moving the funds to higher levels, it claimed.He allegedly received his share of the proceeds through various firms belonging to liquor businessman Trilok Singh Dhillon, transferring it through banking channels to his family firms and using it in real estate projects.Furthermore, he was also found to have received and invested large sums of money generated out of the scam through banking channels via his family members, friends, and associates, the chargesheet claimed.The probe agency said, ""Evidence indicates that Chaitanya, along with managing the proceeds of the crime at a higher level, received around Rs 200 crore-Rs 250 crore as his share.""The investigation has also revealed that high-level protection, policy/administrative intervention, and influence provided to the syndicate by Chaitanya Baghel enabled this crime to be perpetrated for a long period, it claimed.""The ongoing investigation suggests the amount involved in the liquor scam is estimated to be approximately Rs 3,074 crore. However, further investigation suggests the total amount of the proceeds of crime generated out of the alleged scam could exceed Rs 3,500 crore,"" it added.The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing the money laundering angle in the alleged scam, arrested Chaitanya Baghel on July 18 following a search at his house, which he shares with his father, a Congress politician, in Bhilai town of Durg district.As per the ED's prosecution complaint (chargesheet) filed earlier, Chaitanya Baghel ""handled"" more than Rs 1,000 crore worth of ""proceeds of crime"" generated from a liquor ""scam"" in the state.The central agency has stated that the alleged scam resulted in a ""massive loss"" to the state exchequer and filled the pockets of beneficiaries of a liquor syndicate.The scam was orchestrated between 2019 and 2022 when then-CM Bhupesh Baghel headed the Congress government in Chhattisgarh.Money was ""illegally"" collected from ""every"" bottle of liquor sold in Chhattisgarh (between 2019 and 2022), said the anti-money laundering agency.Chaitanya Baghel was arrested by the ACB/EOW in September while he was in jail under judicial custody.The ED in January arrested former excise minister and Congress leader Kawasi Lakhma, businessman Anwar Dhebar (brother of Congress leader and former Raipur Mayor Aijaz Dhebar), former IAS officer Anil Tuteja, Indian Telecom Service (ITS) officer Arunpati Tripathi and a few others as part of their probe in the case.The EOW/ACB registered an FIR on January 17, 2024, in the alleged scam, naming 70 individuals and companies, including Lakhma and former chief secretary Vivek Dhand.After his son was arrested, former CM Baghel claimed that the action was taken because the Congress, during its rule, tried to stop the cutting of forests and mining activities in the state.The Congress leader also alleged that the probe agencies were being misused to target Opposition leaders.

Rahul Gandhi's Congress with his ideological patron George Soros wants Chaos, Unrest in Indian Democracy. Rahul goes abroad for uniting such Anti India forces,"" Bhandari wrote on a post on X.""Congress hates Indian Democracy. Congress hates Bharat's progress.

Our intelligence agencies, ED and CBI, have been weaponised. ED and CBI have zero cases against the BJP, and most of the political cases are against the people who oppose them.

What are the models that are required, how do you think about production in a democratic environment, and what are the types of partnerships that India, the US and Europe can create for production? It will become very difficult for democracy to sustain itself if we are not able to produce,"" he said.""A huge part of the turbulence that we are seeing in Europe, India and the US, polarisation of politics, is because we are not able to give our people jobs, which is because we said: China, you produce for the world,"" he added.Rahul Gandhi is on a five-day visit to Germany.His remarks come after he had claimed that manufacturing in India is declining.During his visit to the BMW World museum in Munich, Germany, on December 17, he said, ""Manufacturing is the backbone of strong economies.

For us to accelerate growth, we need to produce more - build meaningful manufacturing ecosystems, and create high-quality jobs at scale.""However, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari refuted the Lok Sabha LoP's claim, calling it ""fake news"" against India's growth story.The BJP Spokesperson, in an X post, claimed 495 per cent growth in total electronics manufacturing in the last 10 years, with exports growing by 760 per cent, and a 14 times increase in the automobile manufacturing since 1991.","Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of ""capturing the country's institutional framework"" Union minister of state Shobha Karandjale also attacked Congress leader, claiming that he goes abroad to ""speak against the nation"" Rahul is on a five-day visit to Germany, where he had claimed that manufacturing in India is declining.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126132725,imgsize-238048,width-400,resizemode-4/rahul-gandhi.jpg"

‘Not Misleading Propaganda’: Bangladesh Responds To India Over Delhi High Commission Protest

Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], December 23 (ANI): The Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) on Monday wrote to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , seeking urgent intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of Indian medical students currently studying in Bangladesh amid ongoing protests, tensions, and incidents of violence, particularly in Dhaka and surrounding regions.In the letter addressed to the Prime Minister, the Association urged him to intervene to ensure the safety and protection of Indian medical students in view of the prevailing unrest and uncertain conditions in Bangladesh.National Convenor of the Association, Nasir Khuehami, said that there are around 9,000 Indian students pursuing medical education in various colleges across Bangladesh, among them over 4,000 students from the Kashmir Valley.Khuehami said, ""We have been told by students studying in Dhaka that they have been advised to hide their identity for their own safety, which is deeply disturbing and unacceptable for young Indians who have gone abroad solely to pursue education."" He added that the reported ""death and lynching of a student leader has further shocked and alarmed the entire student community and their families back home,"" underlining the gravity of the situation and the potential risks faced by Indian students on the ground.Highlighting the plight of students, the Association said, ""Many students are confined to hostels and accommodations, facing restrictions on movement, lack of clarity, and fear of being caught in violence. Parents in India are living in constant anxiety, unsure about the safety of their children. The prevailing conditions are unsafe and uncertain, and students feel vulnerable and stranded.""Khuehami said the Association has been receiving distress calls and messages from students and their families, who are extremely anxious about the rapidly deteriorating situation and the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty prevailing there.Urging immediate action, Khuehami said, ""We urge the Prime Minister to kindly intervene to ensure the immediate safety and protection of Indian medical students in Bangladesh. We request the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian High Commission in Dhaka to urgently take up this matter with the Government of Bangladesh and seek firm assurances for the security, dignity, and well-being of our students.""The Association also appealed for evacuation if the situation worsens, stating, ""If the situation of tension and violence continues or worsens, the Government of India should kindly consider making arrangements to evacuate and bring back Indian students safely to India, so that no young life is put at risk. Timely evacuation, if required, will go a long way in preventing any untoward incident and in reassuring anxious families across the country. ""Reposing faith in the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Association said, ""India has always stood by its citizens abroad in times of crisis. We are confident that every possible step will be taken to protect our students and uphold India's responsibility towards its youth.

"IIT, Australian university develop nanotech drug delivery for breast cancer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-australian-university-develop-nanotech-drug-delivery-for-breast-cancer/articleshow/126131585.cms,"Representative image

CHENNAI: A tiny needle system that sends cancer drugs directly into breast cancer cells, while protecting healthy ones, has been developed by researchers from IIT Madras and two Australian universities - Monash University and Deakin University. The nanotechnology injection delivery system packs the anticancer drug, doxorubicin, into special protective bubbles, then pushes it inside cells using needle-shaped silicon tubes on a chip.""It was a study on petri dishes,"" said IIT-M assistant professor Dr Swathi Sudhakar, who works with the department of applied mechanics and biomedical engineering. ""We could release the drug directly, but that would be faster delivery. So, for sustained release, it was wrapped in a bubble and pushed into it. Lab tests on breast cancer cells showed the drugs stopped cell growth, killed cancer cells, and blocked new blood vessels for tumours,"" Dr Sudhakar said.Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women in both urban and rural areas. In cities such as Chennai, 28% of cancers in women are breast cancers, followed by cervix (14%), ovary (6%), and corpus uteri (4%).Conventional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation often harm non-cancerous tissues due to systemic drug exposure, causing side effects.Results of the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Advanced Materials Interfaces show the new system worked 23 times better than the drug alone. ""It had higher potential even when used in smaller amounts. There is thermal stability and long-term drug release, up to 700 hours, and it addresses common drawbacks of existing nanocarrier systems, such as burst release and poor compatibility,"" she said.The technology, they said, is a reliable and scalable candidate for future trials.","Nanotechnology injection system packs anticancer drug, doxorubicin, into special protective bubbles.

NEW DELHI: Disrupted sleep, rising stress levels and central obesity are emerging as major drivers of India's growing breast cancer burden, which is projected to rise by 5.6% annually and add nearly 50,000 new cases every year, according to a major new study by the ICMR-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research.The systematic review and meta-analysis analysed Indian studies published up to Dec 22, 2024, to identify population-specific risk factors. Of nearly 1,900 scientific papers screened, 31 observational studies of moderate to high quality were included.Among lifestyle-related factors, individual studies showed a positive association between breast cancer risk and poor sleep quality, irregular sleep patterns, sleeping in illuminated rooms and high stress levels - reflecting the impact of urbanisation and changing work-life patterns. Regular physical activity, the researchers noted, was consistently associated with a lower risk.Central obesity was identified as a critical factor, with women having a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.85 or higher facing significantly elevated risk. Abdominal fat, researchers noted, plays a more decisive role than overall body weight, particularly among postmenopausal women.Clinicians say these lifestyle shifts are increasingly shaping breast cancer patterns in India.Dr Samit Purohit, director of medical oncology at Action Cancer Hospital, said breast cancer is no longer driven only by age or inherited risk. ""Disrupted sleep cycles, chronic stress and central obesity are becoming silent but powerful contributors, as they alter hormonal balance, immune surveillance and inflammatory pathways,"" he said, adding that irregular sleep suppresses melatonin-a hormone with protective anti-cancer properties-while chronic stress leads to sustained cortisol elevation and metabolic dysfunction.The meta-analysis also found strong links with reproductive and hormonal factors, including late menopause (after 50 years), delayed first pregnancy or childbirth (after 30), multiple abortions and higher age at marriage, all of which increase lifetime hormonal exposure. Family history of cancer, particularly breast cancer, emerged as one of the strongest predictors of risk.Researchers noted India's breast cancer risk profile differs from Western populations, where hormone replacement therapy and early menarche are dominant factors. In India, the convergence of lifestyle disruption, reproductive delay and metabolic risk is reshaping disease patterns.The study called for large, population-based prospective cohort studies and stronger emphasis on prevention and early screening.","India's breast cancer burden is projected to rise by 5.6% annually and add nearly 50,000 new cases every year.

Sheikh Hasina Slams Yunus Over Violence In Bangladesh, Calls Out 'Hostile Statements Against India'

Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi, accusing the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over “lawlessness” and claiming the violence reflects a breakdown of governance that has worsened since her ouster.In an email interview with ANI, Hasina said the killing of the youth leader underscored a growing culture of violence under the interim administration, warning that the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.“This tragic killing reflects the lawlessness that uprooted my government and has multiplied under Yunus. Violence has become the norm while the interim government either denies it or is powerless to stop it. Such incidents destabilise Bangladesh internally but also our relationships with neighbours who are watching with justified alarm. India sees the chaos, the persecution of minorities, and the erosion of everything we built together. When you cannot maintain basic order within your borders, your credibility on the international stage collapses. This is the reality of Yunus's Bangladesh,” Hasina said.Her remarks came after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader associated with Bangladesh’s 2024 “July uprising” and spokesperson of the political platform Inqilab Mancho.Hadi was shot at close range by unidentified assailants while travelling in a rickshaw in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area on December 12. He sustained a critical gunshot injury to the head and was initially treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital before being shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition worsened.He was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment and admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit at Singapore General Hospital.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post, stating that he had fought for his life for six days, according to Bangladesh news outlet Daily Star. An aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency, Hadi emerged as a prominent political figure following last year’s uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s removal from office.Hasina also expressed serious concern over the killing of a Hindu youth amid the unrest, linking the incident to what she described as the interim government’s failure to protect minorities and maintain basic law and order.Referring to the lynching of 27-year-old Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh district, the former PM held the Yunus-led administration responsible. Das was allegedly beaten to death by a mob over accusations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire, triggering nationwide outrage.Hasina said such incidents were contributing to diplomatic strain, particularly with India and accused the interim government of allowing extremists to dictate both domestic and foreign policy.“The strain you are witnessing is entirely of Yunus's making. His government issues hostile statements against India, fails to protect religious minorities, and allows extremists to dictate foreign policy, then expresses surprise when tensions rise. India has been Bangladesh's most steadfast friend and partner for decades. The ties between our nations are deep and fundamental; they will outlast any temporary government,” she said.She further claimed that anti-India hostility was being deliberately fuelled by radical elements emboldened under the current dispensation, pointing to attacks on diplomatic facilities, media houses and minority communities.“This hostility is being manufactured by extremists who have been emboldened by the Yunus regime. These are the same actors who marched on the Indian embassy and attacked our media offices, who attack minorities with impunity, and who forced my family and me to flee for our lives. A responsible government would protect diplomatic missions and prosecute those who threaten them. Instead, Yunus grants immunity to hooligans and calls them warriors,” Hasina alleged.Sheikh Hasina also warned of what she described as the growing influence of radical Islamist forces, claiming the interim government had released convicted terrorists and allowed extremist-linked groups to enter public life, raising alarms about Bangladesh’s secular foundations.""I share this concern, as do the millions of Bangladeshis who prefer the safe, secular state we once were. Yunus has placed extremists in cabinet positions, released convicted terrorists from prison, and allowed groups linked to international terrorist organisations to take roles in public life. He is not a politician and has no experience governing a complex nation. My fear is that radicals are using him to project an acceptable face to the international community while they systematically radicalise our institutions from within,"" Hasina said.Separately, Hasina criticised the interim government’s approach to Pakistan, arguing that major foreign policy shifts were being pursued without democratic legitimacy.She said that Bangladesh had long adhered to a balanced diplomatic principle but accused Yunus of moving hastily to reorient ties after alienating traditional allies.“Bangladesh has always believed in friendship to all, malice toward none. Of course it makes sense for our country to have a stable relationship with Pakistan, but Yunus’ headlong embrace is inappropriate. Having needlessly alienated many of our longstanding allies, he now seems desperate to find a friend on the world stage,” Hasina said.She further stressed that the interim administration lacked the mandate to undertake strategic realignments that could have long-term consequences.“The crucial point is this: Yunus has no mandate to realign Bangladesh's foreign policy. He was not elected, so he has no right to make strategic decisions that could impact generations. Once Bangladeshis can vote freely again, our foreign policy will return to serving our national interests, not the ideological fantasies of extremists who have temporarily seized power. The ties between Bangladesh and India are fundamental and will endure long after this interim government is gone,” she added.","Sheikh Hasina slams interim government over death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi.

Poll Will the experience of winning the T20 World Cup in 2024 impact Rohit's approach in the 2027 ODI World Cup? Yes, it will positively influence him No, past experiences do not matter It depends on the team's dynamics

NEW DELHI: In a stunning and deeply personal revelation, former India captain Rohit Sharma has admitted that he contemplated walking away from cricket altogether after India's crushing loss to Australia in the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup in Ahmedabad.Speaking at a Masters' Union event on Sunday, Rohit laid bare the emotional toll of the defeat, describing a period when the sport he loved felt like it had “taken everything” out of him.“After the 2023 World Cup final, I was completely distraught and felt like I didn't want to play this sport anymore because it had taken everything out of me and I felt I had nothing left,” Rohit said.India, under Rohit's leadership, had enjoyed a near-perfect campaign at home, storming into the final with ten straight wins. But in the match that mattered most, Australia executed their plans to perfection. After India were restricted to 240, Travis Head's match-winning century guided the Pat Cummins-led side to a six-wicket victory, leaving a stunned Narendra Modi Stadium in silence.Rohit said the pain was amplified by the sheer emotional investment he had made since taking over the captaincy in 2022.“Everybody was extremely disappointed, and we just couldn't believe what had happened. It was a very tough time for me personally because I had put everything into that World Cup — not just two or three months before it, but ever since I became captain.”The 38-year-old admitted it took months to recover mentally. “There was no energy left in my body. It took me a couple of months to recover and bring myself back,” he said, adding that self-reflection and a reminder of his love for the game helped him find his way back.That resilience would soon define the next chapter. Less than a year after the Ahmedabad heartbreak, Rohit led India to the T20 World Cup title in the USA and West Indies, a triumph he described as a lesson in resetting after disappointment.“I knew life doesn't end there. It was a big lesson — how to deal with disappointment, reset, and start fresh,” Rohit said. “It's very easy to say this now, but at that moment, it was extremely difficult.”Though he has since retired from Tests and T20Is and no longer captains the ODI side, Rohit continues in the 50-over format, with one final dream still driving him — a last shot at World Cup glory in 2027.","Rohit Sharma admits he contemplated quitting cricket after India's 2023 ODI World Cup loss to Australia.

Mahayuti sweeps Phase 1 of Maharashtra local body polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahayuti-sweeps-phase-1-of-maharashtra-local-body-polls/articleshow/126109839.cms,"Image: IANS

BJP-Led Mahayuti Sweeps Maharashtra Local Body Polls; PM Modi, CM Fadnavis Hail Victory

PUNE/NAGPUR: BJP-led Mahayuti delivered a sweeping verdict after two rounds of the first phase of Maharashtra's civic elections, winning presidents' posts in nearly 207 of 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats, mirroring its assembly election performance just over a year ago. Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was reduced to 44 posts.Results were declared on Sunday after polling on Dec 2 and 20.BJP emerged as biggest gainer with victories in over 117 local bodies, cementing the position of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis . Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena secured 53 posts, while Ajit Pawar's NCP won 37.""We have won 117 presidents' posts, and more than 75% posts are with our Mahayuti partners. This is a repeat of the assembly election,"" Fadnavis said.CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “Compared to 2017, our elected representatives have doubled… This is the biggest win in local elections in the last 25 years for any party.”Final results of the 6,859 councillor seats were not released by the state election commission till the time of going to press. But BJP claimed to have won over 3,000 of these seats.Despite emerging as a distant challenger statewide, Congress checked BJP advances in parts of Vidarbha.Western Maharashtra saw Mahayuti allies battling each other as Congress and NCP (SP) struggled to hold ground. Meanwhile, BJP made gains in Mumbai and Konkan, encroaching into traditional Shiv Sena, PWP and NCP pockets. Shinde expanded Sena’s footprint beyond Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), finishing second across the state.North Maharashtra backed BJP strongly, especially in Jalgaon under minister Girish Mahajan. In Marathwada, expected gains from leaders such as Ashok Chavan and Munde cousins failed to materialise. Congress won just 28 civic bodies statewide. Sharad Pawar-led NCP managed seven, while Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena secured nine.Vidarbha delivered a fractured verdict. Congress halted BJP in several councils from Chandrapur to Buldhana and Ballarpur to Wardha, while BJP retained dominance in Nagpur, Gadchiroli and parts of Bhandara.Ajit Pawar-led NCP won 35 of 41 seats in Baramati region, the same undivided NCP had won in 2017. NCP (SP), led by Sharad Pawar, managed to win only one seat, while BSP and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP) also won a seat each. Three seats went to Independent candidates while BJP failed to open its account.The outcome is seen as a curtain-raiser to municipal corporation polls due Jan 15 and comes amid anger over flood-hit kharif crops and opposition charges that funds were diverted to populist schemes such as Mukhyamantri Mazhi Ladki Bahin Yojana. Polls also marked first statewide civic exercise after Shiv Sena and NCP splits, consolidating Shinde and Ajit Pawar as undisputed leaders of their factions.Biggest beneficiary remains Fadnavis. After BJP’s poor 2024 Lok Sabha showing — nine of 48 seats — and his offer to resign, he led Mahayuti to an assembly landslide of over 230 seats, with BJP winning 132. Opposition allegations of “vote chori” and EVM manipulation resurfaced but lost traction after civic sweep.Analysts blamed MVA for failing to capitalise on farm distress. Former CM Prithviraj Chavan admitted Congress could not raise youth and farmer issues effectively.","Results were declared on Sunday after polling on Dec 2 and 20.

Sajid Akram, one of the two men behind the deadly Bondi Beach attack on December 14, had been homeless and living in a series of short-term Airbnbs across Sydney for at least six months before the massacre, new reports show.Even after his death, his estranged wife has refused to claim his body. Now the government is responsible for burial arrangements, according to 7NewsSydney.The 50-year-old was killed during a shootout with police following the ISIS-inspired attack that claimed 15 lives, including a child, and left dozens injured. His son, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was apprehended at the scene and remains in hospital under police guard in critical but stable condition.Authorities have confirmed that Sajid Akram had travelled to Davao City in the Philippines from November 1 to November 28, just weeks before the attack. The area is known as a hotspot for Islamic State activity, and police believe he may have undergone military-style training there. Two other men from Sydney who visited the same region at the same time are now under investigation.Before the attack, the father-son duo reportedly told family members they were going on a weekend fishing trip to Jervis Bay.Instead, they opened fire from a pedestrian footbridge near Campbell Parade, targeting participants of the Jewish Chanukah by the Sea festival, as well as locals and tourists in the area. Loud bangs were heard, and people were seen fleeing for their lives.Investigations are ongoing into how the Akram men obtained high-powered weapons. Police discovered improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the shooters’ vehicle and conducted raids across Sydney, including Naveed Akram’s home in Bonnyrigg. Sajid was originally from Hyderabad and held an Indian passport. He moved to Australia in 1998 and had limited contact with his family back home. His body remains in the morgue in the Coroner's office as of now.The Bondi Beach shooting was treated as an act of terror by the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday again addressed a press conference amid outrage over the ""new definition"" of the Aravali range, saying that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Speaking on the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of Aravalli, the minister said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He futher highlighted the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and international recognition of India’s forest cover, saying that under the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".Addressing concerns in some quarters over a possible expansion of mining activities in the Aravalli Hills and Ranges following the adoption of a uniform definition, Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was incorrect to conclude that mining would be permitted on all landforms below 100 metres in the Aravallis.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravalli can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravalli is protected and secure,” he posted on X.Yadav explained that the Aravali range comprises all landforms located within 500 metres of two adjoining hills with a height of 100 metres or more. All landforms falling within this 500-metre zone, regardless of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases, he said.The minister also elaborated on the issue while responding to a media query on the sidelines of a meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority at the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The query related to the Supreme Court of India’s recent acceptance of a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.Following the apex court’s acceptance that any landform located in the Aravali districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief would be classified as Aravali Hills, some stakeholders expressed apprehension that the move could open more than 90% of the Aravalis to mining, as most landforms lie below the 100-metre mark.","Bhupender Yadav: ""No new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"" Supreme Court accepted a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126121988,imgsize-57824,width-400,resizemode-4/quotmining-possible-only-in-019-area-process-now-stricterquot-environment-minister-bhupender-yadav-backs-new-aravalli-norms.jpg"

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor at the centre of the recent hijab row after Bihar CM Nitish Kumar lifted her naqab during an event did not join duty on Saturday, officials confirmed to news agency PTI. They also reported no contact with her or the family members.Patna civil surgeon Avinash Kumar Singh confirmed that Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.“I have been informed that the last date of joining has been extended beyond December 20. It remains to be seen whether Parveen joins on Monday or not,” he said, without specifying the new deadline.The controversy erupted earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna. The video circulated widely on social media, capturing the moment Nitish Kumar questioned Parveen’s naqab when she came forward to receive her appointment letter along with other Ayush doctors.Also Read: Hijab row: SCBA issues 'strongest condemnation' over Nitish Kumar's act; seeks unconditional apology from Giriraj Singh, Sanjay Nishad Civil surgeon Singh said he was not aware of the reason for Parveen’s delay, as he “had no contact with her or the family members.”Vijay Kumar, a surgeon at Sabalpur PHC in Patna Sadar, where Parveen was supposed to join, also confirmed she had not reported for duty.“Around five-six people have joined today, and Parveen is not among them... Her name is in the list but we have not received her appointment letter from the civil surgeon office in Patna,” he said. As per protocol, candidates must first report to the civil surgeon’s office before joining their assigned workplace.Meanwhile, governor Arif Mohammad Khan expressed disappointment over the controversy.“It pains me to hear the word ‘dispute’ in this case. Can there be any row between a father and a daughter?” he asked.“What have you people made out of it? This man (Nitish Kumar) considers female students as his daughters,” he added while speaking to reporters in Patna.Earlier, Mahfoozur Rahman, principal of Government Tibbi College & Hospital (GTCH), where Parveen is a second-year student, also suggested the joining deadline had been extended “in this special case”.“Ayush doctor Nusrat Parveen has not joined yet, and there is no update on her future course of action,” Rahman said.According to him, the family wants to avoid media attention. “Her family said that they want to escape media coverage, and that the woman doctor will rethink whether to join or not,” he said.Rahman also dismissed rumours that the family had shifted to Kolkata. “They have themselves rubbished such false news reports,” he said, quoting Parveen’s husband as saying the family is not upset with Nitish Kumar or the government.He added that “the family is disappointed with the row stirred by the media.”Rahman said Parveen last attended college on December 17 or 18 and noted that she still has the option to either join duty or pursue higher education.","Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.

‘Local-level confusion’: How Kharge’s remark adds twist to Siddaramaiah vs DK Shivakumar power tussle in Karnataka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/local-level-confusion-how-kharges-remark-adds-twist-to-siddaramaiah-vs-dk-shivakumar-power-tussle-in-karnataka/articleshow/126124755.cms,"Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

NEW DELHI: Who will resolve the ongoing power tussle in Karnataka between chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar - top Congress leadership in Delhi or the leaders themselves at the local level?On Sunday, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge shielded the ""high command"" from this embarrassing power game in Karnataka and said that “any confusion on the leadership issue existed at the local level.” Kharge also added that the local leaders should take ownership of the internal disputes rather than blaming the high command.The remark is not only interesting, given the strong and established high command culture in the grand-old party, but is also open to many interpretations.Did Kharge endorse Siddaramaiah’s claim to continue as chief minister for a full five-year term? After all, he is the chief minister at present and if there is no confusion at the central level on the leadership issue, it perhaps could mean that Siddaramaiah has the support of the high command.The talk about an alleged deal on rotational chief ministership and the demand for DK Shivakumar to take over the top post after two-and-a-half years has been raised by the supporters of the deputy chief minister at the local level. So, by calling the leadership tussle a local issue, is Kharge citing these claims in favour of DKS made by some MLAs and local Congress leaders?Kharge had, in his remarks, also cautioned party leaders against claiming credit for Congress's electoral success in the last assembly elections.""Everyone has built the party. It's not any individual's effort. Congress has been built by party workers. Congress workers supported us,"" Kharge said without naming anyone.This again points more towards the supporters of DK Shivakumar, who have openly claimed that the deputy chief minister, who is also the state Congress president, had played a key role in the party’s spectacular victory in the 2023 assembly elections.The Congress had in 2023 won a comprehensive majority, bagging 135 assembly seats out of 224 with a vote share of 43.2%. The BJP was decimated and reduced to just 66 seats with a vote share of 36.3%.However, the leadership tussle has overshadowed this victory from Day 1. The Congress leadership then had to make a lot of effort and persuasion to convince DK Shivakumar to allow Siddaramaiah to lead the government.There were then reports of an alleged power-sharing arrangement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar. As the Congress government crossed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, speculations intensified about a leadership change. MLAs of both factions have petitioned the high command in support of their leaders.Taking a cue from Kharge’s remark, Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara on Monday said any differences or confusions within the party over the leadership issue in the state have to be resolved locally.""Everyone of us should know, we should resolve ourselves. If the All India Congress president says that you (state leaders) resolve yourself and have nothing to do with the high command, we all have to sit together and resolve,"" Parameshwara said.Chief minister Siddaramaiah, however, reiterated his stand that Congress top leader Rahul Gandhi and the party high command will have to take a decision on the CM change issue, and everyone will abide by their decision.""I don't know about it. Rahul Gandhi and the high command have to decide. Whatever they decide, I'm committed to it,"" Siddaramaiah told reporters here in response to a question on Kharge's statement.""I have spoken to the high command. They have said that they will decide. I will abide by whatever the high command decides,"" he said.Siddaramaiah had on Friday asserted on the floor of the assembly that he would continue in office. He had also said that the Congress high command was ""in my favour"" and asserted that no decision was made on his staying at the helm for only two-and-a-half years.Reacting to his remarks, Shivakumar had said that he and CM Siddaramaiah have come to an agreement with the involvement of the Congress high command, and both of them will abide by it.This is not the first time that DKS has spoken about the power-sharing agreement. In fact, when the tussle had started, he had made a cryptic social media post stating that “word power is world power.”“Keeping one’s word is the greatest strength in the world! The biggest force in the world was to keep one’s word... Be it a judge, president, or anyone else, including myself, everyone has to walk the talk. Word power is world power,” DKS had then written.Siddramaraiah had then responded sharply to this and had countered DKS with his own play of words. ""A Word is not power unless it betters the World for the people,"" Siddaramaiah wrote and detailed the various welfare schemes that his government had launched for people of Karnataka.This power tussle has already caused a lot of embarrassment for the Congress leadership and also raised questions about its ability to resolve disputes between state leaders.Kharge’s remarks have done little to bring clarity on the way forward. It will be interesting to see how DKS responds to his statement, especially on not giving him credit for the party's victory in the 2023 elections.","Mallikarjun Kharge shielded the ""high command"" from this embarrassing power game in Karnataka. Kharge also added that the local leaders should take ownership of the internal disputes rather than blaming the high command.

Uttarakhand mute spectator to grabbing of forest land: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-mute-spectator-to-grabbing-of-forest-land-supreme-court/articleshow/126127802.cms,".

NEW DELHI: SC on Monday expressed concern over forest land being grabbed by private individuals in Uttarakhand and said it was shocking that the state govt remained a silent spectator over the years.While hearing an appeal on a litigation over a disputed parcel of forest land, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi expanded the case and decided to examine the alleged grabbing of 2,866 acres of land - notified as govt forest land - and allegedly leased out in 1950 to Rishikesh-based society Pashu Lok Seva Samiti, which subsequently allotted land parcels to its members.""The facts prima facie show as to how thousands of acres of forest land has been systematically grabbed by private individuals...What seems to be shocking to us is that the State of Uttarakhand and its authorities are sitting as silent spectators when the forest land is being systematically grabbed in front of their eyes. Consequently, we propose to enlarge the scope of these proceedings suo motu. Let notice be issued,"" it said.The bench ordered a probe into the case and sought a report from govt authorities. It directed all parties concerned to maintain status quo.It said land in dispute would not be sold or alienated, and no further construction would be carried out. It directed that no third party right will be created over the disputed land.""The chief secretary and principal chief conservator of forests are directed to constitute an enquiry committee to examine facts and submit a report to this court. Private individuals are restrained from alienating the land or creating third party rights. No construction shall be allowed. The vacant land, other than residential houses, shall be taken into possession by forest department and collector concerned,"" bench said.In this case, a large chunk of land - 2,866 acres - was leased out to Pashulok Seva Samiti in 1950 for allotting it to landless poor families of the area. The society surrendered 594 acres of land to forest dept in 1984.

Large integration halls

A booster production block

A warhead mating facility

A long high-speed sled track for subsystem validation

An environmentally controlled pre-dispatch inspection bay (likened to a cleanroom)

The numbers that matter

Annual production target from Lucknow unit: 80–100 missiles.

Expected revenue contribution by FY 2027-28: Rs 3,000 crore

GST from a single missile: Rs 8 crore. On October 18, DG BrahMos, Jaytirth R Joshi handed over the GST bill and cheque of around Rs 40 crore to the UP chief minister, symbolising revenue generation for the state.

Export pipeline: Negotiations ongoing with around dozen countries

Indigenous content in current production block: 83%, moving to 85% in 2026, which includes fully indigenous titanium castings (PTC Industries, Lucknow), solid rocket boosters, airframe (L&T, Godrej), avionics (HAL & Data Patterns), and inputs from 200+ Indian MSMEs.

The next frontier

Lucknow has witnessed many histories. Whispers of nawabs and poets, of rebellion and resilience, have seeped into its very essence. The Ganges, not far away, flowing steadily southward, is bearing witness to the birth of something unstoppable—a supersonic force that is redefining the skies, seas, and soils of a nation on the cusp of global reckoning. This is not a factory; it is a crucible. Sprawling over 200-acre canvas on the city’s outskirts, the state-of-the-art BrahMos Aerospace Integration and Testing Facility , India’s most formidable conventional deterrent—the supersonic BrahMos cruise missile—is being born, assembled, and given its wings.The journey began in 2018 when the Uttar Pradesh government offered 200 acres of prime land along the Lucknow-Kanpur highway as part of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor (UPDIC). BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL), the Indo-Russian joint venture between DRDO and Russia’s NPO Mashinostroyeniya, had outgrown its Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Pilani and Nagpur’s production and system integration units. Orders were pouring in: the Indian navy wanted more ship- and submarine-launched missiles, the air force was integrating the air-launched version on forty Su-30MKIs, the army needed extended-range land variants, and — most importantly — export enquiries were turning into hard contracts.The Philippines had already taken delivery of its first battery in 2024 under a 375 million USD deal. Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Argentina, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were in various stages of negotiation. By 2025 BrahMos Aerospace had firm orders for over 800 missiles in the next five years. Existing facilities simply could not cope.So, Lucknow happened.Built at a cost of around Rs 380 crore, the new campus is a city within a city: massive integration halls, a booster production block, a warhead mating facility, long high-speed sled track for subsystem validation, and an environmentally controlled pre-dispatch inspection bay that looks more like a spacecraft cleanroom than a weapons factory.Every variant of the BrahMos family — from the original 290 km land and ship versions to the 600 km extended-range and the lighter BrahMos-NG under development — will roll out from here.This year on May 11, defence minister Rajnath Singh virtually inaugurated the facility, the crown jewel of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor (UPDIC), was conceived with a singular, powerful objective: to become the epicentre for meeting the soaring domestic and international demand for the BrahMos weapon system.“The state-of-the-art BrahMos Integration and Testing facility in Lucknow has been set up to cater to the growing demand for BrahMos weapon systems in the domestic and international markets. Its strategic location, a logistical advantage with seamless access to national freight corridors, ensures that the fury assembled here can be dispatched with efficiency to any frontier,” said an official source.On October 18, the defence minister in presence of chief minister Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath , department of defence R&D and chairman DRDO Samir V Kamat, and DG BrahMos Jaytirth R Joshi, flagged off the first batch of missiles to the Indian Armed Forces, sleek and lethal in their transporter canisters, it marked a paradigm shift. For decades, defence manufacturing was perceived as the preserve of coastal or traditional industrial hubs. Lucknow’s roar announced a new geography of power.Built at an estimated cost of Rs 380 crore, the campus is described as a “city within a city,” designed for end-to-end integration and quality validation. Key components mentioned include:The aim: produce and support multiple BrahMos variants—from legacy 290 km versions to extended-range and the under-development BrahMos-NG.BrahMos Aerospace employs around 300-500 people directly at the Lucknow unit today, but the ripple effect is staggering.A senior BrahMos official explained: “A missile is an extremely complex system that draws on diverse industries, advanced materials, chemicals, rubber, electronics, mechanical subsystems, precision machining, welding, and more. Today, BrahMos works with over 200 private and public-sector industry partners across India who supply components, sub-assemblies, off-the-shelf items, and specialised fixtures to build the complete weapon system. """"With demand rising sharply, both from the Indian armed forces and export orders, we need to significantly diversify and expand our supply chain. The new Lucknow facility, located at the heart of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Corridor, offers the ideal platform to onboard many more MSMEs and manufacturers in the region. Proximity will enable tighter project monitoring, faster iteration, and even higher quality standards,"" added the officialThe official added that the company is actively scouting new vendors in and around Lucknow to support production targetsFurther, the human capital powering this enterprise is as meticulously curated as the technology. BrahMos Aerospace, as a world-class defence entity, adheres to a creed of pure meritocracy.“We recruit highly skilled professionals involved in designing a very high-end weapon system. We adhere to the same standards for Lucknow,” stated the official source. There is no quota for locality; excellence is the only passport.For a young engineer dreaming of contributing to missile technology, the path is clear and demanding.A stellar academic foundation in aerospace, mechanical, electronics, or computer science is the entry ticket. The recruitment funnel—through national vacancies and elite campus placements—involves rigorous technical assessments, multiple interview rounds, and stringent security clearances. The promise of “huge employment opportunities” is real, but they are opportunities earned in the most competitive arena.At present, the Lucknow facility will roll out the existing BrahMos missile to meet increased demand, but its specific purpose is to manufacture the BrahMos NG missile—NG stands for next generation. The BrahMos NG will have a 300 km range, equal to the current missile, but will be significantly lighter, at 1.2 tonnes (1,200 kilograms) compared to the existing model’s 2,900 kilograms.The new BrahMos NG would be integrated on Sukhoi 30. Currently, the Su 30 can integrate only one missile, but with the NG version, five missiles can be integrated: four on Light Combat Aircraft. On land and ship versions, instead of three missiles, six or eight can be packed, thanks to the reduced size. This approach aims to maintain effectiveness while increasing numbers and reducing costs, ensuring steady supply to the armed forces. The Lucknow facility will be its birthplace.An official source summed it up: “The BrahMos Integration and Testing Facility is an ultra-modern manufacturing unit designed for the production, assembly, and integration of all BrahMos variants, including the advanced air-launched version. It will also serve as the hub for the next-generation BrahMos in the foreseeable future.”","BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL) had outgrown its Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Pilani and Nagpur’s production and system integration units.

Murshidabad Tense as Humayun Kabir Faces Heat Over ‘Babri Masjid’ Foundation and Heavy Deployment

Political sparring over new outfit

Babri-style mosque move

NEW DELHI: West Bengal MLA Humayun Kabir on Monday launched his new political party, the Janata Unnayan Party, days after the Trinamool Congress (TMC) suspended him over his decision to lay the foundation stone for a Babri-style mosque in Murshidabad district.Speaking at a public meeting in Beldanga, Kabir said his party will contest the 2026 West Bengal assembly elections. He named eight candidates who will be fielded in the polls, though he did not say how many seats the party will contest in total. ""We can only tell you later how many seats we will be finally contesting,"" he told the gathering during the inauguration.Kabir, who is the MLA from Bharatpur, said he plans to contest from two assembly seats, Rejinagar and Beldanga, in Murshidabad.The ex-Trinamool leader further said he aimed to remove West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee from power in the upcoming assembly elections, which are due in less than six months. Kabir claimed that the chief minister has changed and is no longer accessible to ordinary people.""Mamata Banerjee is no longer the same person I knew. She is beyond the reach of the common man,"" he alleged, challenging her to win even a single seat.""I challenge Mamata Banerjee directly; show me that you can win a single seat.We will reduce Mamata Banerjee's party to zero in Murshidabad,"" Kabir claimed. ""I also want to warn the BJP. If they field candidates in 200 seats, I will show them by winning 100 seats,"" the JUP chief added.Earlier, the suspended MLA had asserted that he would emerge as a “kingmaker” in the 2026 West Bengal Assembly elections. He predicted that neither the ruling TMC nor the BJP would secure a simple majority, estimating that no party would cross the 148-seat mark in the 294-member Assembly.“I will be kingmaker after the elections. No one can form a government without my support,” Kabir said. He further claimed that his new party would contest 135 seats and win enough constituencies to play a decisive role in government formation. “Whoever goes to take oath as the chief minister will need the support of my party’s MLAs,” he added.While the TMC has not reacted directly, chief minister Mamata Banerjee accused the BJP of trying to drive a wedge among Muslims in Bengal while addressing a party meeting in Kolkata.Meanwhile, the BJP has dismissed Kabir’s move with state BJP president Samik Bhattacharya saying Kabir would not have any impact in the elections and accused him of working indirectly to help the TMC return to power.BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said, “Humayun Kabir is an agent of the TMC. Mamata Banerjee deliberately got Humayun Kabir to form a party to create polarisation, so that Muslim voters who are unhappy with Mamata do not shift to the opposition but instead move separately. This entire script has been written by Mamata Banerjee.""Kabir was suspended by the TMC on December 4 after his statement on building a Babri-style mosque sparked controversy. Two days later, on December 6, the anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 — Kabir went ahead and laid the foundation stone for the mosque at Rejinagar.Over the past decade, Kabir has been associated with several major political parties in West Bengal. He was expelled by the TMC in 2015 after criticising Mamata Banerjee and alleging that she was promoting her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee. He later contested the 2016 Assembly elections as an independent but lost. He then joined the Congress, before moving to the BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Kabir contested the Murshidabad Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket in 2019 but finished third. He later returned to the TMC and won the Bharatpur Assembly seat in 2021.","West Bengal MLA Humayun Kabir on Monday launched his new political party, the Janata Unnayan Party.

NEW DELHI: Rather than having an adverse impact on BJP's coffers, scrapping of electoral bonds in Feb 2024 ended up boosting its donations kitty in 2024-25, with electoral trusts alone disbursing over Rs 3,577 crore to the party.In 2023-24, BJP's total receipts through voluntary contributions had stood at Rs 3,967 crore, of which Rs 1,686 crore came via bonds and Rs 856 crore through trusts. With electoral bonds scrapped, corporate donors still seeking partial anonymity - as regards party-wise break-up of their contributions - appear to have settled for the electoral trust (ET) route while retaining BJP as the top beneficiary.The party in office at the Centre cornered 83.6% of the nearly Rs 4,276 crore contributions routed through electorate trusts, according to data on the EC website. Compared to 2023-24, this marks an over four-fold rise in corporate donations to BJP through this route. Congress accounted for 7.3% and Trinamool Congress for 3.6% of contributions made through the ET route.The donations via electoral trusts are only a part of total contributions received by parties. The other sources include individuals, corporates, institutions and welfare bodies donating directly. Over the past years, the volume of non-trust donations has consistently exceeded that from contributions via trusts.Of the Rs 3,577.5 crore contribution receipts of BJP in 2024-25 though trusts, Rs 2,180.7 crore was disbursed by Prudent Electoral Trust (ET), Rs 757.6 crore by Progressive ET, Rs 460 crore by A B General ET, Rs 150 crore by New Democratic ET, Rs 30.1 crore by Harmony ET, Rs 21 crore by Triumph ET, Rs 5 crore by Jaybharath ET, Rs 3 crore by Samaj ET, Rs 9.5 lakh by Jankalyan ET and Rs 7.75 lakh by Einzigartig ET.Congress received Rs 216.3 crore from Prudent in 2024-25, Rs 77.3 crore from Progressive, Rs 15 crore from AB General ET, Rs 5 crore from New Democratic ET and Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET. Thus, the grand old party received over Rs 313 crore of its total 517 crore contributions in 2024-25 via the trust route.Prudent maintained its position as the top trust donor to political parties, having disbursed a total of Rs 2,668 crore to 15 parties in the last financial year. The Tata Group-linked Progressive ET was a distant second with its total contributions at Rs 915 crore in 2024-25, of which Rs 757 crore went to BJP, Rs 77 crore to Congress and Rs 10 crore to eight other parties.Prudent's Rs 2,668 crore kitty was distributed among BJP (Rs 2,180.7 crore); Congress (Rs 216.3 crore); Trinamool Congress (Rs 92 crore); YSR Congress Party (Rs 88 crore); TDP (Rs 40 crore); AAP (Rs 16.4 crore); Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (Rs 10 crore); BRS, JDU, BJD and AJSU (Rs 5 crore each); Sikkim Democratic Front (Rs 2.5 crore); LJP and NCP (Rs 1 crore each); and Praja Shanthi Party (Rs 50 lakh).A B General ET made Rs 460 crore worth of corporate donations to BJP and Rs 15 crore to Congress. The Mahindra Group-backed New Democratic ET gave Rs 150 crore of its total Rs 160 crore contributions to BJP, with Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT receiving Rs 5 crore each. Triumph disbursed Rs 21 crore to BJP and Rs 4 crore to Telugu Desam Party. Harmony ET contributed Rs 30.1 crore to BJP, Rs 3 crore to Shiv Sena-UBT and Rs 2 crore to NCP-Sharad Pawar. Jan Pragati Electoral Trust disbursed Rs 1 crore to Shiv Sena.Congress's receipts in 2024-25 fell way short of the Rs 828 crore it had received via bonds in 2023-24 but were higher than its Rs 171 crore bond income in 2022-23, a non-general election year. Similarly, TMC's Rs 184.5 crore receipts in 2024-25, of which Rs 153.5 crore were through trusts, were no match for its Rs 612 crore receipts via bonds in 2023-24. BJD, which received Rs 245.5 crore in bonds in 2023-24, received Rs 60 crore in donations, including Rs 35 crore via trusts, in 2024-25. BRS not only saw its Rs 495 crore receipts in bonds (2023-24) eroded, but also its receipts from trusts, which dipped to Rs 15 crore from Rs 85 crore in 2023-24.","In 2023-24, BJP's total receipts through voluntary contributions had stood at Rs 3,967 crore, of which Rs 1,686 crore came via bonds and Rs 856 crore through trusts.

In J&K, fresh snowfall ushered in the 40-day-long Chillai-Kalan. Gulmarg recorded nearly two inches of snow accumulation, emerging as the only weather station in the Valley to log sub-zero temperatures, with the mercury plunging to minus 1.5°C. Sonamarg witnessed continuous snowfall from early morning through the afternoon.Despite snow, Srinagar recorded its warmest night of the season, with the minimum temperature settling at 4°C, six degrees above normal. However, at least 11 flights were cancelled at Srinagar International Airport due to adverse weather conditions.Himachal Pradesh experienced biting cold conditions as snowfall draped high-altitude areas of Lahaul-Spiti and Chamba districts. Snowfall was recorded at Shinku La, Rohtang Pass and parts of Pangi Valley, with flakes later observed near Atal Tunnel.Snowfall, though light, drew large numbers of tourists to Shinku La, located around 5,000 metres and being developed as a new snow tourism destination.Meanwhile, the mid and lower hills remained under dense cloud cover, prolonging a dry spell that has left Himachal with a 100% rainfall deficit this month.IMD has warned of moderate to severe snowstorms at isolated places in Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti.In the plains, the winter chill intensified across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh as thick fog enveloped several areas. Narnaul in Haryana emerged as the coldest location in the state, with mercury dipping to 5.2°C, while Gurdaspur was Punjab's coldest at 6.8°C. Dense to very dense fog reduced visibility to under 50 metres in parts of UP, where cold day to severe cold day conditions were reported in pockets, along with isolated areas of Uttarakhand.

Simit's family, who had reported him missing when he didn't return to Sitonga with the group he had accompanied to Jharkhand in search of work, was told that the suspects killed him during a liquor-fuelled brawl on October 17.Investigators said the suspects had ""confessed"" to the murder.

The road ahead

If demography can be a dividend, geography certainly decides its destiny. Few landscapes illustrate this more clearly than the Aravalli Range, an ancient chain of hills that quietly shapes water security, climate, and life across western and northwestern India.The hills that run for nearly 690 km from Gujarat through Rajasthan and Haryana to Delhi, forming the oldest fold mountain system in the subcontinent, have become the center of a long-running environmental and legal debate.At the heart of the issue is a simple but emotive question. What exactly counts as the Aravalli range? The answer matters because this classification determines which areas can be mined, built upon, or conserved.A recent ruling by the Supreme Court has accepted a ""standard definition"" proposed by the central government to identify what qualifies as the Aravalli Hills. While the move was intended to bring clarity to long-standing disputes, the definition’s limited ecological lens has raised fresh concerns about environmental protection and sustainable development.In November, the Supreme Court agreed with a proposal by the central government on how the Aravalli hills should be officially identified.The court said that only those hills that rise at least 100 metres above the surrounding land, or groups of such hills located close to each other, will be considered part of the Aravalli range for regulatory purposes.The court also asked the Union government to carefully map the region and prepare a clear plan for managing it. This plan will include rules on where mining can take place and how it should be regulated. The aim is to remove confusion caused by different government records and maps, which have often led to disputes and court cases in the past.Environmental experts maintain the significance of the Aravalli hills is not about how tall they are, but about what they do.The hills work like a natural water storage system, with their rocky structure allowing rainwater to slowly seep underground and refill aquifers. These aquifers supply water to many towns in Rajasthan and big cities such as Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, and Alwar. Studies even show that large-scale mining and cutting of hills damage this process, leading to long-term loss of groundwater.The Aravallis also help slow the spread of the Thar Desert towards eastern India. Scientists warn that if the hills continue to be damaged, desertification could increase, along with dust storms and extreme heat in the Indo-Gangetic plains.Although the region is dry, the Aravalli hills support forests, scrubland and grasslands. These habitats are home to wildlife such as leopards, hyenas, nilgai and many bird species. Conservationists say these ecosystems are fragile and can be easily broken apart by mining and construction.The current controversy is primarily rooted in decades of judicial scrutiny. Since the 1980s, courts have intervened repeatedly to curb unregulated mining in the Aravalli belt, particularly in Rajasthan and Haryana.Multiple Supreme Court orders in the 1990s and early 2000s restricted mining in notified forest areas, citing environmental degradation, air pollution and public health risks. However, enforcement remained weak due to the absence of a universally accepted definition of what constituted the Aravalli range.Mining operators and developers often argued that certain hillocks or plateaus did not legally qualify as Aravallis, even if they were ecologically linked to the system. This ambiguity reportedly created administrative paralysis and prolonged litigation, prompting the Centre to seek a standardised definition.Government officials and legal experts defending the Supreme Court’s ruling argue that the elevation-based criterion introduces clarity into a highly subjective domain. They say that by setting a measurable threshold, authorities can avoid arbitrary decisions and reduce disputes over land classification.In its observation, the top court acknowledged the need to balance environmental protection with economic realities. Mining of stone and minerals in the Aravalli region supports livelihoods and supplies essential materials for construction and infrastructure. A blanket ban, the SC noted, could have severe economic consequences if not backed by clear scientific and legal parameters.The ruling has drawn criticism from ecologists, hydrologists, and civil society groups who believe that the 100-meter threshold oversimplifies a complex landscape like the Aravalli.They point out that many ecologically critical features of the Aravalli system, including recharge zones, wildlife corridors and low-lying ridges, do not meet the elevation criterion but are vital to the range’s environmental function. Excluding these areas from automatic protection, critics say, could open the door to expanded mining and construction.Experts also warn that mining impacts are cumulative, as even shallow or small-scale extraction can permanently alter drainage patterns and soil stability, consequently reducing the land’s ability to absorb rainfall. In arid and semi-arid regions, such damage is often irreversible.Once this order is implemented in full force, which is for mining purposes, environmentalist Vimlendu Jha said, ""tomorrow it could be real estate or other things that could begin in the region, which is also the main fear of the locals of the entire region.""Disagreeing with the new definition of Aravalli, Jha said, ""the mountain is not just a piece of rock assembled together. Aravalli, which is the oldest mountain range in the world, is also an ecosystem."" He said, ""If mining is allowed...Aravalli, which is above the ground, is also under the ground. So it's not just the tree cover, green cover, or the national dust shield or weather shield it provides, but at the end of the day, temperature and air quality between Thar and Delhi are maintained because of the shield of the Aravalli. ""Shedding light on the risk arising from the new definition that ""lifts the protection,"" he said, risk is that all of this will be a large-scale plundering of this area and not just by mining, but also by other areas like real estate.""Once we start calling it a forest and not a range, and it falls under a semi-urban landscape or rural landscape rather than a protected landscape, it will be open for any kind of exploitation through economic-commercial activity,"" he told TOI.Talking about the impact on the Delhi-NCR region, which witnesses toxic-air-driven health hazards every year, Jha said, ""Firstly, desertification increases when we compromise with the buffer we have. Secondly, when the dust increases, the PM10 level we have in the Delhi-NCR is pathetic and therefore the risk or the intensity of air quality increases. Aravalli's entire area is also the main water recharge table, so the water sufficiency of the region is also questioned because of mining. ""Magasaysay awardee Rajendra Singh, known as the ""Waterman of India,"" said earlier governments and courts took nature and environmental issues seriously, but that approach has disappeared.""If this decision, meant to benefit one individual, is implemented, only 7-8 per cent of the Aravalli will survive,"" he told news agency PTI, calling for a legal battle as well as mass public mobilisation.Amid concerns in some quarters over a possible expansion of mining activities in the Aravalli Hills and Ranges following the adoption of a uniform definition, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was incorrect to conclude that mining would be permitted on all landforms below 100 metres in the Aravallis.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravalli can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravalli is protected and secure,” he posted on X.Yadav explained that the Aravali range comprises all landforms located within 500 metres of two adjoining hills with a height of 100 metres or more. All landforms falling within this 500-metre zone, regardless of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases, he said.The minister also elaborated on the issue while responding to a media query on the sidelines of a meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority at the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The query related to the Supreme Court of India’s recent acceptance of a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.Following the apex court’s acceptance that any landform located in the Aravali districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief would be classified as Aravali Hills, some stakeholders expressed apprehension that the move could open more than 90% of the Aravalis to mining, as most landforms lie below the 100-metre mark.Yadav, however, stressed that all landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling hills of 100 metres or more, irrespective of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases.The Supreme Court’s directive to conduct scientific mapping is now seen as the critical next step. Environmental lawyers say the outcome will depend on how comprehensively the mapping exercise incorporates hydrology, biodiversity and geomorphology, rather than focusing solely on elevation. Transparency will also be key.Civil society groups have demanded that maps and management plans be made public and subjected to independent scientific review. Without such safeguards, they argue, the process risks becoming a procedural formality rather than a tool for genuine conservation.At its core, the Aravalli debate reflects a broader challenge in India’s environmental governance. How to reconcile development pressures with the protection of natural systems that do not conform neatly to administrative boundaries or numerical thresholds.As climate stress intensifies and water scarcity deepens across north-west India, the fate of the Aravalli range carries implications far beyond the hills themselves. Whether the Supreme Court’s attempt at regulatory clarity strengthens or weakens environmental protection will depend on how the ruling is implemented on the ground, which ultimately remains at the mercy of bureaucracy.For now, India’s oldest mountain range stands at a crossroads, its fate being debated and defined by modern institutions that are only a moment in time compared to the ancient geology they now seek to regulate.","The Aravalli Range is an ancient chain of hills that quietly shapes water security, climate, and life across western and northwestern India. The hills that run for nearly 690 km from Gujarat through Rajasthan and Haryana to Delhi have become the center of a long-running environmental and legal debate. A recent ruling by the Supreme Court has accepted a ""standard definition"" what qualifies as the Aravallis.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126103486,imgsize-102416,width-400,resizemode-4/aravalli.jpg"
G RAM G: BJP accuses Omar Abdullah of mocking faith,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/g-ram-g-bjp-accuses-omar-abdullah-of-mocking-faith/articleshow/126127289.cms,"SRINAGAR: Two days after J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah said the name of the new rural employment guarantee scheme, G RAM G, reminded him of Bollywood film ‘Ji Mummy Ji’, BJP on Monday accused him of ridiculing people’s faith.At a press briefing, BJP spokesperson Abhijeet Jasrotia said the CM should have refrained from commenting on the name. Describing it as a matter of faith, Jasrotia said, “The chief minister should not make jokes about the name. We strongly object to this and will not tolerate it.” Omar held a constitutional post and must exercise restraint while talking on issues linked to faith, he added.Omar had on Saturday questioned the Centre’s move to replace MGNREGA with Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin), or VB-G RAM G, and had also expressed surprise over the nomenclature. “First of all, I am surprised where this name came from,” he said. “Who names a bill as G RAM G?” He also criticised the dropping of Mahatma Gandhi ’s name from the employment scheme.Jasrotia said Omar’s family has had longstanding associations with religious and cultural traditions linked to Lord Ram, and it was unfortunate the CM had forgotten these. His father Farooq Abdullah publicly sang bhajans dedicated to Lord Ram, and the chief minister should respect such tradition in his own family, the spokesperson added.Defending the re-naming, BJP said welfare schemes ensuring dignity of labour and livelihood security were in keeping with Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals. “Gandhiji stood for empowering the weakest sections. Any initiative that guarantees work and food security reflects that vision. If in Gandhi’s time the scheme would be renamed as such, he would have been happy about it,” Jasrotia said.","J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah said the name of the new rural employment guarantee scheme reminded him of Bollywood film ‘Ji Mummy Ji’ BJP on Monday accused him of ridiculing people’s faith.

‘Do Namune’ Dig By Yogi Adityanath Ignites UP Assembly Clash, Akhilesh Accuses BJP Of Decorum Breach

What were the protests about?

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday took a veiled dig at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi during a state Assembly session, saying “” (There are two specimens in the country).The remarks came amid a heated debate in the Assembly over the alleged illegal trade of codeine-based cough syrup, prompting strong protests from the SP and noisy demonstrations inside and outside the House.Speaking during the winter session, Adityanath said, “ 'Desh ke andar do namune hain'. One sits in Delhi and the other in Lucknow. When there is any discussion in the country, they immediately flee the country, and I think the same thing is happening with your ‘Babua’. He will also leave the country again for a trip to England, and you people will keep shouting here.”The remarks came in response to opposition questions on deaths allegedly caused by codeine syrup, though UP CM did not name them explicitly.He categorically denied any fatalities due to the syrup in Uttar Pradesh: “No deaths have occurred in Uttar Pradesh due to codeine cough syrup. Secondly, action will be taken in this case under the NDPS Act.The Uttar Pradesh government has won this case in court.”Yogi added that the biggest wholesaler first apprehended by the STF had been licensed during the Samajwadi Party’s tenure in 2016.Giving an update on enforcement, the chief minister said, “The government has registered 79 cases, named 225 accused and arrested 78 people. Raids have been conducted on 134 firms. No accused in this case will escape, and preparations will also be made for bulldozer action when the time comes.” He also suggested that a deeper investigation may reveal links to the Samajwadi Party.""I think if you delve deeper into this matter, you'll find that ultimately, some leader or individual associated with the Samajwadi Party is involved. The High Court has ruled that this entire case should be prosecuted under the NDPS Act. The Uttar Pradesh government has fought this battle and won."" he stated.The remarks drew strong reactions from Akhilesh Yadav. He criticised the public spat between leaders and the use of personal attacks in political discourse.In a post on X, Samajwadi chief wrote: “Self-Acceptance! No one expected the Delhi-Lucknow feud to escalate to this point. People holding constitutional positions should at least maintain some public decorum and not cross the bounds of propriety. BJP folks should not bring their party’s internal squabbles out to the crossroads.”Earlier, Akhilesh had alleged that the codeine racket originated from the Prime Minister’s parliamentary constituency.“A state’s chief minister lies, and those standing with him also lie. You can’t imagine that an illegal cough syrup business is operating from the Prime Minister’s parliamentary constituency… it’s worth thousands of crores. This is an international issue,” he said. Yadav called for strict bulldozer-style action against all “mafias,” irrespective of political affiliation.Earlier today, Samajwadi Party members held demonstrations outside the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly. The protest came amid outrage over the alleged illegal trade of codeine-based cough syrup and what the party described as government inaction.SP legislators, including both MLAs and council members, staged a sit-in near the main gate of Vidhan Bhavan, holding placards with anti-government slogans and demanding strict action against those involved in the syrup racket.During the protest, SP members raised slogans against UP CM, alleging that people from his own caste and close associates were involved in the illegal trade. The party accused the government of prioritizing profits over public health and youth welfare.A statement from the Samajwadi Party media cell on X read: ""Chief Minister Adityanath is running the business of poisonous and intoxicating cough syrup. People from his own caste and his close associates are involved in the illegal trade. Is their greed for money so intense that the deaths of children and addiction among youth have no effect on them? What kind of yogis are these who have gone to such extremes for money? How do they call themselves honest with what face? Is this their yoga, this their saintliness, and this their so-called honesty?""SP legislators also raised other issues during the protest, including alleged manipulation of voter lists, curtailment of reservation rights, and collapse of health services.The Uttar Pradesh police said a Special Investigation Team is probing the illegal network involved in storage and distribution of regulated codeine-based cough syrups, including financial transactions and cross-border links to Nepal and Bangladesh.",Yogi Adityanath took a veiled dig at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi during a state Assembly session.

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns expressed in certain quarters over the possibility of expansion of mining activities in the Aravali Hills and Ranges in the wake of its new uniform definition, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was absolutely wrong to conclude that the mining is permitted in all landforms below 100 metres height as there has been no relaxation made at all in the Aravali.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravali can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravali is protected and secure,” he posted on X.The Aravalli Hills and Ranges are among India’s oldest geological formations, stretching from Delhi through Haryana, Rajasthan, and into Gujarat. Only a very small area is under permitted mining leases and out of this small percentage, nearly 90 % of the mining activity is confined to Rajasthan, followed by about 9% in Gujarat and about 1% in Haryana. No mining activity is permitted in Delhi.Yaav said the Aravali range has been explained as all the landforms which exist within 500 metre of two adjoining hills of height of 100 metres or more. All landforms existing within this 500 metre zone irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease, said the minister.He also clarified the issue in detail in response to a media query on the sidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s meeting at Unesco World Heritage Site Sundarbans.The question pertained to the recent Supreme Court's acceptance of uniform policy level definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges specifically in the context of regulating mining.Yadav, however, emphasised that all the landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling Hills of height 100 metre or more irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease.The Opposition parties had raised the issue in the Parliament during the concluded winter session, claiming that the definition would exclude most of the Aravali range from protection. In the wake of the SC's Nov order of accepting the Centre-backed definition, Congress general secretary and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh called the move a severe blow to the Aravali ecosystem.""The Aravalli Hills extend from Delhi through Haryana and Rajasthan to Gujarat. Over the years they have been devastated by mining, construction, and other activities in violation of all regulations and laws. Now it appears that this sensitive and sprawling ecosystem will be subject to another severe blow,"" Ramesh had posted on X.Referring to media reports, he had said, ""This definition is meant to restrict mining but in reality will mean that 90% of the Aravalli Hills will not be counted as Aravalli any more. Evidently, the Supreme Court has accepted this revised definition. This is bizarre and will have very grave environmental and public health consequences. It calls for an immediate review.""Former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot too opened a front against the SC recent move, blaming the Centre for pitching for that uniform definition. Yadav on Sunday, however, appealed to everyone to ""stop spreading confusion"" and even explained how the Rajasthan government has been following the definition since 2006.His ministry also explained that all Aravali range states/UT during deliberations agreed to adopt the uniform criterion of “100 metres above local relief” for regulating mining in the Aravalli region as had been in force in Rajasthan while unanimously agreeing to make it more objective and transparent.""All the landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling Hills of height 100 metre or more irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease. Similarly, Aravali range has been explained as all the landforms which exist within 500 metres of two adjoining Hills of height 100 metre or more. All landforms existing within this 500 metre zone irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease,"" the ministry clarified.By defining Aravalli Hills as any landform rising 100 metres or more above local relief, along with their supporting slopes, the entire ecological unit is protected. This prevents piecemeal exploitation of slopes or foothills that are vital for soil stability, water recharge, and vegetation cover.""","The Aravalli Hills and Ranges are among India’s oldest geological formations, stretching from Delhi through Haryana, Rajasthan, and into Gujarat.

NEW DELHI: India has moved closer to inking deals to export BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to Vietnam and Indonesia, which collectively will be worth over Rs 4,000 crore ($450 million).Russia, the joint developer of BrahMos missiles that fly at almost three times the speed of sound (Mach 2.8), has assured India that it has no objection to the precision-strike weapon being sold to Vietnam and Indonesia, defence sources said.With the assurance being given during the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov on Dec 4, a formal no-objection certificate is now awaited from Moscow. “Both Vietnam and Indonesia, after agreeing to the initial deals, may go for more orders in the future,” a source said.Once the deals are inked, Vietnam and Indonesia will become the other Asean countries after the Philippines to buy the air-breathing missiles. India had inked a $375 million contract to supply three anti-ship BrahMos coastal batteries to the Philippines in Jan 2022. “Manila, too, is likely to order more BrahMos missiles,” the source said.All three countries, incidentally, have major concerns over China’s strong-arm tactics and expansionism in the South China Sea, with confrontations escalating, especially between Manila and Beijing, over the last couple of years.India, on its part, had successfully deployed the BrahMos missiles, whose range has been increased to 450 km from the original 290 km, from Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets for targeted strikes deep into Pakistan during Operation Sindoor in May.Over the years, Indian armed forces have inked deals worth around Rs 60,000 crore with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace, with the missiles becoming the prime conventional (non-nuclear) precision-strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.India also plans to begin inducting the new 800-km BrahMos from 2028 onwards, with tests currently underway for the extended-range missiles with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades, as was earlier reported by TOI.Apart from Brahmos missiles, India wants to sell the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a 25-km range, and Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems to the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam as well as other “friendly countries” like the UAE and Brazil.While India is still in the strategically vulnerable position of being among the top three arms importers in the world, it exported a wide range of arms, ammunition, defence sub-systems and components, worth nearly Rs 24,000 crore, to around 80 countries in the 2024-25 fiscal.In this, Armenia is one of India’s biggest clients of ‘finished’ weapon systems like Akash air defence missile systems, Pinaka rocket systems and 155mm artillery guns, as was reported by TOI earlier.",Vietnam and Indonesia will become the other Asean countries after the Philippines to buy the air-breathing missiles.

NEW DELHI: The India-New Zealand FTA ran into some political opposition in Wellington as the right-wing New Zealand First (NZF), a member of the ruling coalition, opposed the deal, calling it neither free nor fair. NZF leader Winston Peters, who is also the foreign minister of New Zealand, said his party would vote against the enabling legislation as and when it's introduced.""Regrettably, this is a bad deal for New Zealand. It gives too much away, especially on immigration, and does not get enough in return for New Zealanders, including on dairy,"" said Peters.However, the opposition Labour Party was reported to have indicated support for the legislation when it's introduced in Parliament. According to Peters, while New Zealand is completely opening its market to Indian products under the deal, India is not reducing the significant tariff barriers currently in place for New Zealand's major dairy products. ""The India FTA would be New Zealand's first trade deal to exclude our major dairy products -- including milk, cheese and butter. In the year to Nov 2025, New Zealand exports of these products were worth around $24 billion, or 30% of our total goods exports,"" said the minister.","The India-New Zealand FTA ran into some political opposition in Wellington.

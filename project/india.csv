Who was

CV Raman

Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was born on November 7, 1888, in Tiruchirappalli.

His father, a lecturer in mathematics and physics, provided him with an academic environment from an early age.

In 1902, he enrolled at Presidency College, Madras, and graduated with a BA in 1904, securing the first rank and a gold medal in physics.

He earned his MA degree in 1907 with highest distinction.

Raman's initial research in optics and acoustics—the two fields he dedicated his career to—began during his student years.

At that time, pursuing a scientific career was not considered the most viable option, so in 1907, he joined the Indian Finance Department.

Despite his official duties, he continued experimental research at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in Calcutta, where he later became Honorary Secretary in 1919.

In 1917, he accepted the newly endowed Palit Chair of Physics at Calcutta University.

After 15 years at Calcutta, he moved to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, serving as a professor from 1933 to 1948. In 1948, he became the Director of the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, which he founded and funded himself.

In 1926, he established the Indian Journal of Physics and served as its editor. He also played a key role in founding the Indian Academy of Sciences and became its president.

and became its president. In 1930, Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the 'Raman effect.'

He was honoured with the Bharat Ratna in 1954.

in 1954. On November 21, 1970, at the age of 82, he passed away in Bangalore.

India celebrates National Science Day on February 28 each year to honor Sir CV Raman's discovery of the Raman Effect in 1928.This year's theme, 'Empowering Indian youth for global leadership in science and innovation for Viksit Bharat,' highlights the crucial role of young minds in advancing India's scientific and technological progress.In 1986, the National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC) recommended that February 28 be declared National Science Day by the Government of India. Since 1987, it has been observed annually to honour the discovery of the Raman Effect and foster a scientific mindset across the nation.","India celebrates National Science Day on February 28 each year to honor Sir CV Raman's discovery of the Raman Effect in 1928.

'Physically tired and mentally retired': Prashant Kishor's jibe at Bihar CM Nitish Kumar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/physically-tired-and-mentally-retired-prashant-kishors-jibe-at-bihar-cm-nitish-kumar/articleshow/118614804.cms,"Nitish Kumar (left) and Prashant Kishor

NEW DELHI: Political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor on Thursday urged voters to ensure that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s party, the JD(U), does not win any seats in the upcoming assembly elections. He described Kumar as ""physically tired and mentally retired"" and accused him of staying in power by frequently switching alliances.Speaking to reporters in Patna, Kishor said Kumar had remained chief minister despite the JD(U) having only a small number of seats by shifting alliances. He recalled that Kumar broke ties with the BJP in 2013, later joined the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan in 2015, returned to the BJP in 2017, moved back to the RJD camp in 2022, and then rejoined the NDA last year.""To break this cycle, and to ensure that the arrow (JD(U)'s poll symbol) does not float with the lotus (BJP) nor burn bright with the lantern (RJD), I appeal to the people that they vote in a manner that the JD(U) does not win even one seat. Only then would we be rid of the chief minister who is physically tired and mentally retired,"" Kishor said.Moreover, Prashant Kishor, a former JD(U) national vice president, also criticized the BJP, saying it was using Nitish Kumar as a ""mask"" while holding power. He alleged that the recent cabinet expansion, just months before the elections, was aimed at misusing public money and appeasing certain castes.""Swearing in 7 new ministers 6 months before the term of this government ends simply means that they want to loot the people before tenure of the government ends,"" Prashant Kishor said.Also read: Bihar Cabinet expansion: CM Nitish Kumar allocates portfolios to 7 newly-inducted BJP MLAs Claiming that the people were dissatisfied with both the ruling NDA and the RJD-led opposition, Kishor announced plans for a ""Badlo Bihar Rally"" on April 11.

Though we also foresee the possibility of the jittery in the ruling dispensation trying to pave hurdles by denying permission,"" he said.Kishor was also asked about recent statements by the chief minister’s son, Nishant Kumar, who has insisted that his father is ""100 per cent"" fit and capable of serving another term. This has led to speculation about Nishant’s possible entry into politics.Responding to this, Kishor said, ""I do not want to say much about Nishant since he is not in public life. But I challenge his father to spell out the names of ministers in the state cabinet without looking at a piece of paper. If Nitish Kumar thus demonstrates his mental soundness, I would give up politics and start working for him.""Recently, Kishor was arrested while on a fast demanding the cancellation of the BPSC exams.","Political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor urged voters to ensure that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s party, the JD(U), does not win any seats in the upcoming assembly elections.

India and

Australia

are fast turning into indispensable partners in the Indo-Pacific, buoyed not just by the success of the Quad grouping but also increasing cooperation in areas like education, defence, people-to-people contact and trade. Australian High Commissioner

Philip Green

sat down for a roundtable with TOI editors on a range of issues, including the return of Donald

Trump

as US prez. Edited excerpts:

Students staying back, and undocumented people

Skilled migration

Australian universities in India and mutual recognition of degrees

Bilateral ties

Scope of a full trade pact

Anti-India extremists in Australia

Adani’s Australia coal project

Trump’s treatment of allies

Future of Quad

Anti-India extremists in Australia

The Australian government and people are very unsympathetic to people who want to arrive without documentation. We have made a huge effort over the last 10 years to virtually remove that as a possibility and... that has helped undergird the support for the regular migration programme.The Australian High Commission in New Delhi is the largest offshore visa processing unit worldwide. We issued halfa-million visas last year [including] about 50,000 students, and about 1,00,000 people for skilled migration. Australia has retained for India the right of people to remain after their study. The length of stay for Indian nationals, as agreed in the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement, is as follows:●Bachelor’s degree (including honours) – 2 years●Bachelor’s degree (with first class honours in STEM, including ICT) – 3 years●Master’s (coursework, extended and research) – 3 years●PhD – 4 yearsThe flow of migration between India and Australia continues at a good rate and is very much supported in our society. But there are some areas where, frankly, I’d like to see more. I’d like to make it easier for Indian nurses and other healthcare professionals to make their way to Australia. That’s an area where we have a deficit and you have something of a surfeit.The way in which we think about it is that we have global rules which allow for people to migrate on the basis of skills. Indians tend, more than others, to meet those criteria.Two foreign universities have opened a branch in India and they are both Australian — Wollongong and Deakin . They’re both more than fully subscribed. One more Australian university, University of Western Sydney, has announced that it will open a campus here in Noida. I’m very confident that we will be announcing more Australian universities opening campuses in India before too long.On recognition of degrees, that’s a university-to-university province. And it would not be normal for one university to recognise a whole slate of degrees from another university. What is really good is what is called articulation, when typically somebody does a year or two here in India and then transfers and does a year or two in Australia and gets a degree from both of those universities together. And I think that’s where the future lies.I came here with a mandate from our PM to drive [our relationship] as far and fast as we possibly could. And we’ve had good progress over a year and a bit that I’ve been here. From our perspective, there are three fundamental drivers behind this bilateral relationship: the first is strategic alignment. We see India as indispensable to framing a balance in our region that is sustainable.The second is our economic complementarity. India is the fastest growing big economy in the world. We confidently predict it’ll be the third biggest economy by 2030. [That’s] of particular interest to us... because we’re neighbours [and also] a highly complementary economy. We naturally produce the sort of things that India will need for the next generation of its growth. Energy is obvious. Minerals, especially critical minerals, and skills and training.You will have seen how successful we have been in attracting students from all around the world. And Indians particularly. Now, over 1,30,000 Indians are studying in Australia.The third driver of our relationship is what we describe as a human bridge. The fact that there are now a million people of Indian origin who live in Australia. We’ve only got 26 million on the continent. It’s the fastest-growing ethnic group in Australia. Indian languages are the fastest-growing language group in Australia.The first phase of our trade agreement is going very well and that has given us greater reason to want to conclude a second phase. Part of that would be in order to strengthen the supply chain in important inputs like critical minerals... and encourage our investors and yours to take a bigger interest in each other’s countries. A part of that would be for us to be able to provide a greater degree of cooperation with the Indian agriculture sector.Australia is a democracy and we take the right of peaceful protest very seriously. And people who live in our country are entitled to take their views to the public domain so long as, and only so long as, that doesn’t involve violence or some form of intimidation of other communities. The bit of it that I’m most closely involved in is the protection of Indian diplomatic and consular agents and their premises... and I am confident that our agencies are doing a really good job.The coal project is doing fine for us. It’s producing coal that’s being shipped to India. My dealings with the group have been very largely in the field of renewable energy. We want people to take an interest in our renewable sector. We have a target of 82% of our grid being green just by 2030. That’s up from about 35% just at the start of this govt. Investors from around the world are looking at Australia as an opportunity.I don’t see evidence of the US turning inward. PM Modi was the fourth major leader and there are many others who’ve made their way to the US in the few weeks since President Trump was inaugurated. It was evident President Trump was going to bring a different sort of character to his domestic and international dealings. And that’s the way it is.Our focus is on the Quad continuing to signal that these four democracies [Australia, India, Japan, US] are prepared to expend substantial effort to maintain an order in our region which is free and open and prosperous and resilient. Areas where we will be as active or more active in the future will include maritime domain awareness, critical technology and, particularly, undersea cables, and in fields like responding to humanitarian and other disasters in the region.trade agreement is going very well and that has given us greater reason to want to conclude a second phase.

Ekta ka Maha Kumbh: The dawn of a new era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ekta-ka-maha-kumbh-the-dawn-of-a-new-era/articleshow/118614664.cms,"At Maha Kumbh

The Maha Kumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. A grand Mahayajna of Unity has been completed. When the consciousness of a nation awakens, when it breaks free from the shackles of a centuries-old mindset of subjugation, it breathes freely in the fresh air of renewed energy. The result of this was witnessed at the Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh (Maha Kumbh of Unity) in Prayagraj since January 13.On January 22, 2024, during the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya, I spoke about Devbhakti and Deshbhakti — devotion to the divine and to the nation. During the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, Gods and Goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together. We witnessed the awakened consciousness of the nation. This was Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh, where the sentiments of 140 crore Indians converged at the same place, at the same time, for this sacred occasion.In this holy region of Prayagraj is Shringverpur , a sacred land of unity, harmony and love, where Prabhu Shri Ram and Nishadraj met. Their meeting symbolized the confluence of devotion and goodwill. Even today, Prayagraj inspires us with the same spirit.For 45 days, I witnessed crores of people from every corner of the country making their way to the Sangam. The wave of emotions at the confluence kept rising. Every devotee came with one purpose — taking a dip in the Sangam. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence.This Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj is a subject of study for modern management professionals, planning, and policy experts. Nowhere in the world is there any parallel or example of this scale.The world watched in wonder how crores of people gathered at Prayagraj at the banks of the confluence of rivers. These people had no formal invitations, no prior communication on when to go. Yet crores of people left for the Maha Kumbh of their own accord and felt the bliss of taking a dip in the sacred waters.I cannot forget those faces radiating immense joy and satisfaction after the holy dip. Women, elders, our Divyang brothers and sisters — everyone found a way to reach the Sangam.It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of India’s youth. The presence of the younger generation at the Maha Kumbh sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers of our glorious culture and heritage. They understand their responsibility towards preserving it and are committed to carrying it forward.The number of people who arrived in Prayagraj for this Maha Kumbh has undoubtedly created new records. But beyond those physically present, crores of people who could not reach Prayagraj were also deeply connected emotionally to the occasion. The sacred water brought back by pilgrims became a source of spiritual bliss for millions. Many of those returning from the Maha Kumbh were received with respect in their villages, honoured by society.What has happened in the last few weeks is unprecedented and has laid a foundation for centuries to come.More devotees arrived in Prayagraj than anyone had imagined. The administration had estimated attendance based on past experiences of the Kumbh.Nearly twice the population of the United States participated in this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh.If scholars of spirituality analyse the enthusiastic participation of crores of Indians, they will find that India, proud of its heritage, is now surging ahead with a new-found energy. I believe this is the dawn of a new era, which will script the future of a new India.For thousands of years, the Maha Kumbh has strengthened India’s national consciousness. Every Purna Kumbh used to witness a gathering of saints, scholars and thinkers deliberating upon the state of society in their times. Their reflections used to provide a new direction to the nation and society. Every six years, during the Ardh Kumbh, these ideas were reviewed. After 12 Purnakumbh occurrences spanning 144 years, obsolete traditions were given up, newer ideas were embraced, and new traditions were created move ahead with the times.After 144 years, in this Maha Kumbh, our saints have once again given us a new message for India’s development journey. That message is Developed India – Viksit Bharat.At this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh, every pilgrim, whether rich or poor, young or old, from villages or cities, from India or abroad, from the East or the West, from the North or the South, irrespective of caste, creed and ideology, came together. This was an embodiment of the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat that filled confidence in crores of people. Now, we must come together in the same spirit for the mission of building a developed India.I am reminded of the incident where, as a little boy, Shri Krishna revealed a snapshot of the whole universe within His mouth to His mother Yashoda. Similarly, in this Maha Kumbh, the people of India and the world have witnessed the massive potential of India’s collective strength. We must now move forward with this self-confidence and dedicate ourselves towards building a developed India.Earlier, the saints of the Bhakti movement had identified and encouraged the strength of our collective resolve across India. From Swami Vivekananda to Sri Aurobindo, every great thinker reminded us of the power of our collective resolve. Even Mahatma Gandhi experienced it during the freedom movement. Post-independence, if this collective strength had been correctly recognised and harnessed towards boosting the welfare of all, it would have become a great force for a newly independent nation. Unfortunately, it was not done earlier. But now, I am gladdened to witness the way in which this collective strength of the people is coming together for a developed India.From the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the ancient scriptures to modern satellites, India’s great traditions have shaped this nation. As a citizen, I pray that we draw new inspiration from the memories of our ancestors and saints. May this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh help us move ahead with new resolutions. Let us make unity our guiding principle. Let us work with the understanding that service to the nation is service to the divine.During my election campaign in Kashi, I had said, “Maa Ganga has called me.” This was not just an emotion but also a call of responsibility, towards the cleanliness of our sacred rivers. Standing at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in Prayagraj, my resolve became even stronger. The cleanliness of our rivers is deeply linked to our own lives. It is our responsibility to celebrate our rivers, big or small, as life-giving mothers. This Maha Kumbh has inspired us to keep working towards the cleanliness of our rivers.I know that organizing such a massive event was no easy task. I pray to Maa Ganga, Maa Yamuna, and Maa Saraswati to forgive us in case there were any shortcomings in our devotion. I see Janata Janardan, the people, as an embodiment of divinity. In case there has been any shortcoming in our efforts to serve them, I also seek the forgiveness of the people.Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh , I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogi Ji , the administration and the people worked together to make this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh a success. Be it the state or Centre, there were no rulers or administrators and instead, everyone was a devoted sevak. Sanitation workers, police, boatmen, drivers, people serving food everyone worked tirelessly. The way the people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts despite facing many inconveniences was particularly inspirational. I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to them and the people of Uttar Pradesh.I have always had unwavering confidence in the bright future of our nation. Witnessing this Maha Kumbh has strengthened my conviction manifold.The way 140 crore Indians turned the Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh into a global occasion is truly wonderful. Moved by the dedication, devotion and efforts of our people, I will soon visit Shri Somnath, the first among the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the fruits of these collective national efforts to Him and to pray for every Indian.The physical form of the Maha Kumbh may have culminated successfully on Mahashivratri, but just like the eternal flow of the Ganga, the spiritual strength, national consciousness and unity that Maha Kumbh has awakened will continue to inspire us for generations to come","The Maha Kumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence. It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of India’s youth. It sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118614676,imgsize-811135,width-400,resizemode-4/118614676.jpg"

Poll How Can Universities Better Prevent Student Harassment? Awareness And Support Programs Stricter Policies And Enforcement

DEHRADUN/PITHORAGARH: In a corner of Bhubaneswar, a hostel room has been emptied. Its door, indistinguishable from the others lining the corridor, remains locked. Inside, the personal touches that once marked the space are gone, leaving no trace of the young woman who aspired to build a future there. Yet, beyond these walls, the name Prakriti Lamsal resonates. In Odisha, where students are protesting. In Kathmandu, among Nepal 's student communities, within govt offices and the PMO.Days after Prakriti's death, her father, Sunil Lamsal, searches for answers while holding onto his belief that India will deliver justice for his daughter. ""Since the era of Ramayan, both countries have maintained the roti-beti ka rishta,"" he told TOI over the phone from Kathmandu on Wednesday. ""I cannot be in Odisha for the entire duration of the probe, but I am confident that the Indian govt will do what it needs to.""Also read: Nepal human rights body seeks probe into KIIT-Bhubaneswar student death The roti-beti ka rishta — a bond of livelihoods and marriages that has long blurred the borders between Nepal and India — has long tied the people of the two countries, Lamsal said, repeating, as if to emphasise a hope. Prakriti, 20, was one such daughter. A third-year computer science student at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), she had left her home in Bhairahawa, 5km from the Indian border at Gorakhpur, to pursue a future in India. She had told them she'll be back as an engineer.The Lamsals had first heard of KIIT through university-led events in Kathmandu. Prakriti's cousins, Anurodh and Siddhant, were also students there; she and Anurodh in computer science, Siddhant in mechanical engineering. Like many international students, she arrived with ambitions — big but not uncommon. A degree. A job. A better life for her family, especially her little brother she doted on.There were two things, Lamsal said, Prakriti cared about the most: becoming an engineer and looking after her nine-year-old brother, Prayas. She adored him. ""She wanted to get him into the best school, to shape his future. She was shy, but always willing to help others. A bright career has been cut short. I have lost my daughter — she wanted to set an example for others to follow. Those responsible should not go unpunished.""Also read: How a Nepali student’s death sparked chaos at Odisha’s KIIT Prakriti had always been quiet, a little reserved, Lamsal said. But at KIIT, she had spoken up. Twice. She had filed two complaints against a fellow student, alleging harassment. The university responded by calling in both students for ""counselling"". But her family was never informed. ""No action was taken,"" Lamsal said. ""A firm action could have saved her.""On Feb 16, two hours before her death, Prakriti called her mother. They talked about studies, family matters. Nothing seemed amiss. ""There was no indication of the anxiety she was carrying,"" her father said. A few hours later, the family got the news.Afterwards, the community of 1,500-odd Nepalese students at KIIT erupted in protests. More than 500 students were allegedly asked to vacate their hostels following the unrest. The Nepalese embassy stepped in, sending officials to assess the situation and provide support. ""If it weren't for them (the students), this may never have come to light,"" Lamsal said.When Nepal's PM K P Sharma Oli spoke to Prakriti's parents on Tuesday, he promised them what little could still be given: attention, intervention, the weight of Nepal's diplomatic and legal resources. ""This news has deeply saddened me. It has brought grief to all of us. We cannot change what has happened. It was an unfortunate event… An investigation is underway,"" he told them over the phone. He placed his faith in Indian authorities. He assured the family that justice would be done.Prakriti's father listened, stifled sobs, then spoke. ""Many Nepali children are studying in India. We do not want such incidents to recur. Our govt must take proactive steps in this matter,"" he said. He thanked the PM, but it was not just gratitude — it was a warning, a plea. Oli repeated what he had said: ""Nepal is watching this case.""There was another phone call. Nepal's foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba spoke to Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi. She used different words but asked for the same thing — an ""impartial investigation, legal action, accountability"". Nepal's National Human Rights Commission, too, sent its own request, urging its Indian counterpart to investigate Prakriti's death and ensure that it would not become just another case file.""We are waiting, watching,"" Lamsal said. ""Nepal is too.""","Prakriti Lamsal, 20, was a third-year computer science student at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology. She had left her home in Bhairahawa, 5km from the Indian border at Gorakhpur, to pursue a future in India. She filed two complaints against a fellow student, alleging harassment. But her family was never informed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118590936,imgsize-1325553,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118590936.jpg"

'I am a born Hindu': Shivakumar's response to critics in party. Should Congress be worried?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-am-a-born-hindu-shivakumars-response-to-critics-in-party-should-congress-be-worried/articleshow/118608323.cms,"Shivakumar vs Siddaramiah in Karnataka

Why should the Congress be worried?

NEW DELHI: Is the Congress staring at a crisis in yet another party-ruled state? Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar 's holy dip at the Maha Kumbh and his visit to Sadhguru 's ashram for Mahashivratri celebrations, where home minister Amit Shah was also present, have raised the hackles of some Congress leaders triggering a row that may leave the grand-old-party worried.Shivakumar has reacted strongly to criticism over his ""spiritual"" pursuits from a section of the party - with one senior leader invoking Rahul Gandhi's name to attack the Karnataka Congress leader.In a hard-hitting post on X, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary PV Mohan targeted Shivakumar's Coimbatore visit and wrote: ""Thanking for an invitation from someone who mocks RG (Rahul Gandhi), the hope of the nation & aligns with RSS's narratives, while serving as a president of a secular party, it misleads party workers. It is conviction rather than compromise (that) ensures the party's growth. Otherwise, it damages the core.""When asked about objections to his visit from within the party, a combative Shivakumar said: ""I am a Hindu. I am a born Hindu and I will die as a Hindu but I love and respect all religions. Our Congress president's name is Mallikarjun Kharge . Who is Mallikarjuna? It's Shiva only. Should he change his name?""""Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev of Isha Foundation came and invited me (for Shivaratri celebrations in Coimbatore). He is from Mysuru. He is a great man and I admire his knowledge and stature but there are many who criticise him,"" he said.The Karnataka deputy chief minister also had good things to say about the Maha Kumbh organised by the Yogi Adityanath government.""My experience regarding Maha Kumbh was very good. I appreciated the way they organised it. It is not a small job. There might be some problems here and there. Trains may have caused problems. I don't like to find faults. It is very satisfactory,"" Shivakumar said.Earlier, responding to allegations of cozying up to the BJP, Shivakumar had called it a conspiracy against him and had invoked Sonia Gandhi to silence his critics.""The Congress party has the doctrine of taking everyone together. Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and Indira Gandhi have done the same. I have seen Sonia Gandhi celebrating the Ugadi festival. She has adopted Indianity rather than us. We have such leadership,"" he said countering criticism.In 2023 Shivakumar had lost out to Siddaramaiah for the chief minister's post in a very tight race after Congress's emphatic victory in Karnataka assembly elections. After days of persuasion, he settled for the post of deputy CM while retaining the position of state president. At that time there were reports of a power-sharing agreement under which Shivakumar would have got the top post after two and a half years. However, there was no official confirmation of this.While Shivakumar's supporters have made regular claims about the rotational CM deal, the Karnataka Congress strongman has backed Siddaramaiah to the hilt, especially when the chief minister faced all-round attack over the MUDA land scam. But the fact remains that Shivakumar was a strong claimant for the top post and would want some assurance from the party leadership on it going forward.The Congress did well in the bypolls held last year winning all the three seats where elections were held. Recently the Karnataka Congress president held a meeting with those candidates who had lost the last elections to prepare a blueprint for their victory in 2028. This was perhaps a clear indication of his desire to lead the party in the next elections.It is in this context that Shivakumar's spiritual pursuits could be a message to the party leadership.The Congress has already suffered in several states due to leadership tussle and has even lost its governments.In Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia campaigned vigorously for the Congress in the lead up to the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls in 2018. Following Congress's win, Kamal Nath was chosen as the chief minister. But Kamal Nath couldn't complete his five-year term and had to step down as the chief minister after Scindia and 22 Congress MLAs resigned from the assembly and moved to the BJP.In Haryana, Bhupinder Singh Hooda took complete control of the Congress campaign and in the process several senior leaders were sidelined. Kumari Selja, a prominent Dalit face of the party, objected to this dominance and stayed away for most part of the campaign.In Rajasthan, bittter leadership tussle between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot made headlines for long. Gehlot refused to accommodate Sachin and his supporters. Eventually, Pilot revolted against Gehlot and was on the verge of quitting the party. However, Priyanka Gandhi then intervened and persuaded him to stay back. The faction-ridden Congress eventually lost the assembly elections to the BJP.In Assam, having led the Congress's campaign successfully in 2011, Himanta wanted to be the chief minister. He was seen as the successor to then chief minister Tarun Gogoi. But then came Tarun Gogoi's son, Gaurav Gogoi, on the political scene disrupted the handing over of the baton.Himanta resigned from the Gogoi Cabinet in July 2014, citing ""family-centric"" politics. He joined the BJP and campaigned for the party for the 2016 assembly polls. The BJP came to power in Assam that year and Sarbananda Sonowal was made the chief minister. Five years later, in 2021 when BJP won again, Himanta was made the chief minister.Clearly, the Congress would not want another state to slip away from its hands because of leadership tussle. While Shivakumar may have needed the support of 113 MLAs to become the chief minister in 224-member assembly, he will need the backing of far less number of MLAs to destabilise the Siddaramaiah government.", DK Shivakumar's holy dip at the Maha Kumbh and his visit to Sadhguru's ashram for Mahashivratri celebrations have raised the hackles of some Congress leaders. One senior leader invoked Rahul Gandhi's name to attack the Karnataka Congress leader.

India looks to formalise defence cooperation with EU in Indo-Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-looks-to-formalise-defence-ties-with-eu-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/118609765.cms,"While PM Narendra Modi and visiting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will look to boost ongoing efforts for an India-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA), both sides are also likely to discuss ways to formalise defence and security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. This is of particular interest to India as it encourages the EU to become more involved in the region, in favour of freedom, transparency and a rules-based order.As the EU leader landed Thursday, describing India as a friend and a strategic ally, government sources here said the visit had been in the works for the past 6 months, or since both leaders were re-elected last year, and has nothing to do with the EU’s strained alliance with the US under President Donald Trump. On her third visit to India, von der Leyen is accompanied by the EU College of Commissioners.According to Indian authorities, the visit will see significant progress in efforts to ramp up cooperation in areas like technology, particularly AI, green energy, space and defence, even if no major agreement is signed after the meeting that will be followed by a joint statement. Modi’s engagement with von der Leyen and the second meeting of the India-EU Trade and Technology Council during the visit is expected to clear the path for the India-EU summit later this year.Ahead of the talks, official sources here said the EU is showing interest in defence cooperation with India in the Indo-Pacific and the 2 sides have had “informal coordination” between their forces so far. “We might have discussions to formalise this cooperation,’’ said a government source, speaking on condition of anonymity. EU adopted an Indo-Pacific strategy in 2021, and has since worked to enhance its engagement with like-minded countries in the region, but it’s often seen as lacking coherence.Significantly though, in 2023, it appointed a military adviser in India for the first time. According to the Indian government, India and EU are strengthening their defence cooperation under the EU co-funded Enhancing Security Cooperation In and With Asia (ESIWA) programme and it’s expected to come up for further discussions on Friday. They have also conducted joint naval exercise in the past, like in the Gulf of Guinea in 2023In an interview to TOI ahead of her arrival, von der Leyen sought a reinforcement of the EU’s defence and security cooperation with India, saying it will work with India and other countries to uphold the rules-based order in the region. While discussing Europe’s focus on Ukraine, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has on several occasions accused the West of looking the other way when the same order was under stress in the Indo-Pacific.Modi and von der Leyen will also discuss recent developments related to Ukraine, particularly Trump’s talks with Russia to end the war in which he didn’t involve either Europe or Ukraine. The EU leader is expected to engage India on the issue, while briefing Modi about her visit to Kyiv this week, Indian officials here reiterated India’s position: both parties must resort to dialogue and diplomacy as no solution can be found on the battlefield.On Friday, the 2 sides will have a plenary session that will be chaired by von der Leyen and Modi, while the College Members will also meet their counterparts individually. According to the EU, India is its largest trading partner, with trade in goods valued at €124 billion in 2023.","EU adopted an Indo-Pacific strategy in 2021, and has since worked to enhance its engagement with like-minded countries in the region.

Mohalla clinic interactions lasted barely 1 min: CAG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mohalla-clinic-interactions-lasted-barely-1-min-cag/articleshow/118611510.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

NEW DELHI: Doctors at AAP's much-vaunted mohalla clinics were spending less than one minute on consultations with a majority of the patients visiting them. Many of these clinics didn't have basic medical equipment such as pulse oximeters, glucometers, X-ray viewers, thermometers and blood pressure monitoring devices.These startling facts have been revealed in a CAG audit report on revenue, economic, social and general sectors and PSUs.The audit has revealed that 18% of the clinics that were evaluated were non-operational for periods ranging from 15 days to 23 months, primarily because of unavailability of doctors, resignations and de-empanelment. The audit found that 41 of 218 clinics across four districts - North East, South, South West, and West - remained shuttered when the evaluation was carried out. Medical services were significantly affected as 70% of patients who visited the mohalla clinics between Oct 2022 and March 2023 received less than one minute of consultation.The report has also raised serious concerns about the availability of medicines as 74 clinics that were reviewed were found to have failed to maintain complete stocks of the 165 medications listed in the essential drug list (EDL).Supply chain difficulties were particularly evident in medicine distribution with frequent unfulfilled or partially completed orders from suppliers. The audit noted that numerous EDL medicines were either not procured by the central procurement agency or not delivered by vendors despite orders having been placed. Delayed deliveries, ranging from three to six months, further disrupted the clinics’ ability to provide timely care.CAG observed that laboratory services were completely unavailable across Delhi’s clinics from November 16, 2022, to December 14, 2022, with no alternative testing arrangements. After 10 years of AAP’s rule, only 53% of the planned mohalla clinics were established with just 38 facilities added in their second term, falling short of their healthcare goals. AAP administration’s 2015 promise of establishing 1,000 clinics to improve healthcare accessibility remained unfulfilled. The CAG report flagged significant project delays.Despite a budget allocation of Rs 35.16 crore for constructing primary health centres between 2016 and 2023, the administration used only 28% (Rs 9.8 crore) of the allocated funds. By March 2023, directorate general of health services, Delhi govt, had established only 523 clinics, well below the 2017 target of 1,000 clinics.The report has revealed significant deficiencies in essential facilities across numerous mohalla clinics. Out of 81 clinics assessed, various shortcomings were identified: 10 operated without potable water supply, 24 lacked air-conditioning for proper storage of medicines and injections while 21 had no toilet amenities. Six clinics functioned without proper examination tables, 29 were found without fire extinguishers and 12 were inaccessible to differently-abled persons.Furthermore, 20 clinics failed to provide privacy screens for patients during consultations. CAG has pointed out that DGHS had issued an order on Feb 26, 2018, mandating quarterly visits by chief district medical officer’s (CDMO) teams to all mohalla clinics in the district. In Dec 2019, DGHS directed CDMOs to inspect at least one clinic monthly, verifying 10% of OPD entries through patient contact numbers.The monitoring teams were tasked with checking staff punctuality and reviewing various registers, including pharmacy indent, stock and balance, OPD, laboratory and daily consumption. Additional focus areas included proper medicine usage and ensuring all prescriptions carried authorised signatures and stamps from empanelled doctors. The monthly visit reports were to be submitted to the state nodal officer. The audit revealed that only 175 inspections (1.5%) were completed against the required 11,191 inspections of 218 clinics in selected districts between March 2018 and March 2023.","Doctors at AAP's much-vaunted mohalla clinics were spending less than one minute on consultations.

Another brick in union wall: 'Harassed' Kerala owner to shut kiln,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-brick-in-union-wall-harassed-kerala-owner-to-shut-kiln/articleshow/118611931.cms,".

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Trade unionism has dropped a brick on Left-governed Kerala's claim to ease of doing business, with a 57-year-old woman kiln owner in Parassala on the brink of winding up her venture after even a high court order failed to protect her from harassment at the hands of headload workers.Pushpakumari and her husband Thankappan A, a retired state transport corporation employee, have been running the kiln at Chenkal - ""brick"" in Malayalam - for around six years. She alleges that a group of headload workers owing allegiance to CPM-affiliated CITU and Congress-backed INTUC have been obstructing the business in a bid to extract what she says are unreasonable wages.The couple, hailing from Pazhayakada near Thirupuram, recently moved Kerala high court against the unionised workers and obtained an order barring them from disrupting operations at the kiln. The court also directed police to provide protection to the owners and their business.Pushpakumari said little had changed despite the court's intervention, forcing her to contemplate giving up on her kiln. The defiant workers allegedly tore a copy of the court order in front of police. Last Tuesday, they allegedly didn't allow Pushpakumari's regular staff to work.""Not all headload workers create such problems; it is just a group of men with several criminal cases against them. Our employees load 1,000 bricks for Rs 480, receiving an extra Rs 30 as a bonus. The headload workers demand Rs 800 and more,"" she said.Pushpakumari said several orders were cancelled due to delay in delivery caused by the unionised workers.""The court ruled in our favour, but the workers are politically influential, and even police advised us to compromise for the sake of the business. Some of the more aggressive workers threatened to kill us."" Police said the dispute would be resolved soon. ""We have warned the trade union workers not to create any problem,"" an officer said.Kerala organised a global investor summit recently, where chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan promised to remove all obstacles for industrialists and arrange all facilities required for a start-up ecosystem to thrive. Leader of the opposition V D Satheesan, too, extended support in the interest of the state's economic growth.","Pushpakumari and her husband Thankappan A, a retired state transport corporation employee, have been running the kiln at Chenkal for around six years.

"In North India, short winter doesn't always lead to searing summer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-north-india-short-winter-doesnt-always-lead-to-searing-summer/articleshow/118612415.cms,"Representative image

Does an early end to winter imply that summer is likely to be a scorcher? TOI analysed 54-year temperature data for north India to find that a warm Feb doesn't necessarily lead to a hotter than usual month of April.

NEW DELHI: Winter has ended early in north India and February in Delhi is set to be among the three warmest in the last 15 years. So, does the early conclusion of winter indicate a long and scorching summer ahead? Contrary to the general view, data from past years shows that a warm Feb doesn't necessarily lead to a searing summer in north India.TOI analysed monthly average maximum temperatures in north India since 1971 and picked the 10 warmest months of Feb during this period. In five of these years, the corresponding months of April were indeed warmer or significantly warmer than normal but in the other five, April temperatures were either close to normal (four years) or below normal (one year).These two months were chosen for the analysis because Feb is the last month of winter in north India, while April marks the beginning of full-blown summer conditions in the region. March is usually a month of transition.""There is no direct one-to-one relationship between temperatures in Feb and April. Temperatures in these two months depend on multiple factors, including largescale signals such as presence of El Nino (or La Nina) and synoptic features such as the frequency, intensity and duration of western disturbances,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general of India Meteorological Department Trends in recent years exemplify the absence of a link between temperatures in Feb and April. In 2023, north India experienced record heat in Feb but April was cooler than normal. Feb that year was the warmest since 1901, with the average maximum temperature 3.5 degrees above the mean during 1971-2024.However, April that year turned out to be the coolest in eight years, with average maximum temperatures nearly 1 degree below the mean during 1971-2024.The reverse happened in 2022. April of that year in north India was the hottest on record, while temperatures in Feb were close to normal.""In the years when a strong El Nino (or La Nina) prevails, there can be a link between temperatures in the two months. This year, however, we have a weak La Nina that's not expected to influence temperatures,"" Mohapatra said.Another factor that's increasingly playing a role in making both months hotter in general is climate change. ""The past couple of decades have been the warmest on record. So, because of climate change, the probability of any month being warmer than in the past is high,"" said the chief of IMD, which is scheduled to release its forecast for the months of March, April and May soon.","TOI analysed 54-year temperature data for north India to find that a warm Feb doesn't necessarily lead to a hotter than usual month of April.

SC lists riders for arrests by GST and Customs staff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-lists-riders-for-arrests-by-gst-and-customs-staff/articleshow/118611897.cms,"The Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Customs and GST authorities had the power to carry out arrests but could not do so without adhering to the safeguards provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for personal liberty of the accused.Writing the main opinion, CJI Sanjiv Khanna said the safeguards penned in the Arvind Kejriwal vs Enforcement Directorate judgment relating to arrest under Prevention of Money Laundering Act would apply to arrests under Customs and GST Acts . The court introduced safeguards for those facing charges under these Acts.The SC said officials could not take custody of people for alleged violation of the two laws without informing them of the grounds of arrest and laying out ""reasons to believe"" that he had committed an offence under these revenue laws. It also said a person who apprehended arrest was entitled to seek anticipatory bail .A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices M M Sundresh and Bela M Trivedi found force in the argument of the petitioners that assessees were compelled to pay tax as a condition for not being arrested and said this was unacceptable and violative of rule of law.""We would observe that in case there is a breach of law, and the assessees are put under threat, force or coercion, the assessees would be entitled to move courts and seek a refund of tax deposited by them. The department would also take appropriate action against the officers in such cases,"" the bench said.Importantly, the bench upheld amendments in 2012, 2013 and 2019 to the Customs and GST Acts classifying certain offences as cognisable and non-bailable while rejecting the challenge to their validity by as many as 280 petitions. It also upheld powers of Customs and GST officials to summon an assessee while clarifying that mere summoning did not make the person an accused.“The challenge to the constitutional validity, as also the right of the authorised officers under Customs and GST Acts to arrest, are rejected and dismissed with elucidation and clarification on the pre-conditions and when and how the power of arrest is to be exercised,” it said.Reading in the entire arrest procedure under CrPC, along with additional safeguards created by SC judgments, into Customs and GST Acts, the bench said as these two laws didn’t come with complete codes on search and seizure, and arrest, provisions of CrPC would apply unless expressly excluded.Writing the main opinion, CJI Khanna said safeguards it had penned in the Arvind Kejriwal vs ED judgment relating to arrest under PMLA would apply to arrest procedures under Customs and GST Acts. Customs and GST officials now must follow the following procedure — a. The officer must have material in his possession (to effect arrest); b. Based on such material, the authorised officer should form and record in writing, ‘reasons to believe’ that the person to be arrested is guilty of an offence punishable under the concerned Acts; c. The person arrested, as soon as may be, must be informed of the grounds of arrest — and also the doctrine of proportionality (mere questioning will serve the purpose or is arrest essential).SC said, “Courts may employ this fourpart doctrinal test in their examination of the legality of arrest as arrest often involves contestation between the fundamental right to life and liberty of individuals against the public purpose of punishing the guilty.” The bench said unbridled exercise of power to arrest without warrant (for cognisable and non-bailable offence, the police must obtain an arrest warrant from court) could result in arbitrariness and errors in decision-making and such errors made by Customs and GST officials could lead to a frustration of constitutional and statutory rights of the arrested person.",Customs and GST authorities had the power to carry out arrests but could not do so without adhering to the safeguards provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) The court introduced safeguards for those facing charges under these Acts. It also said a person who apprehended arrest was entitled to seek anticipatory bail.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118611899,imgsize-804301,width-400,resizemode-4/118611899.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped inside a parked bus at Pune’s Swargate bus depot in the early hours of February 25. The victim, a working woman, was waiting for a bus to return to her home in Phaltan, about 100 km away, when the accused, Dattatray Ramdas Gade , approached her. He falsely told her that the bus to her destination was parked elsewhere and led her to an empty Shivshahi bus inside the depot. After convincing her to board, he followed her inside, where he allegedly committed the crime before fleeing the scene.Maharashtra’s transport minister, Pratap Sarnaik, has ordered a departmental inquiry. Both the Assistant Transport Superintendent and the Bus Depot Manager are under investigation, with instructions for suspension if negligence is found. In response, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has decided to replace all security personnel at the depot.The Pune city police have released a poster of the suspect, urging the public to come forward with information.The poster mentions that a case under section 64, 351(2) of 2023 has been registered against the accused.As per the poster, ""A case has been registered under section 64, 351(2) of 2023 and the said case is accused named Dattatray Ramdas Gade, age 37 years, Res.

A total of 13 teams, including eight from the Crime Branch and five from Swargate Police Station, are actively pursuing leads. Teams have also been dispatched outside the district.Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Smartana Patil said, “We have declared a Rs 1 lakh cash award for anyone providing information leading to the accused’s arrest.

Additionally, authorities brought in a specialised dog squad to assist with the search efforts in the village, he mentioned.In response to security lapses at the depot, MSRTC has taken immediate measures to enhance safety. The Transport Minister has ordered the replacement of all current security personnel at the Swargate depot.Pramod Nehul, MSRTC’s divisional controller, confirmed that an inquiry is underway to determine how the bus was left unlocked. “All 20 CCTV cameras at the depot were operational, and footage has captured the accused leading the victim into the bus,” he said.Additionally, 23 security personnel have been removed for negligence, and two senior officers are under departmental investigation, TOI had reported.Also read: Two depot officials face probe, 23 guards sacked Dattatray Ramdas Gade has multiple criminal cases, including theft, robbery, and chain-snatching, registered against him in Pune and Ahilyanagar district, news agency PTI reported quoting officials.

Gade also faces charges in Ahilyanagar. In 2024, a theft case was filed against him, and his brother was questioned by Pune police on Wednesday.The survivor, a medical counsellor, narrated that she had reached the bus stand around 5:45 am when the accused approached her, calling her ‘didi’ (sister) to gain her trust. After falsely claiming her bus was parked elsewhere, he led her to an unlit, empty Shivshahi AC bus.Initially hesitant to enter, she used her phone’s torch to look inside, at which point the accused followed her, bolted the door, and allegedly raped her. CCTV footage captured the accused taking her towards the bus and later fleeing.Following the attack, the woman boarded another bus to Phaltan but later returned to Pune after her friend urged her to report the crime. She immediately approached the police, leading to a formal case registration and the launch of the manhunt.Also read: Traumatised survivor returns to city, goes to police after friend's call Authorities have sent the bus for forensic examination to collect evidence. DCP Patil confirmed that the accused had worn a mask during the assault, making initial identification difficult. However, the police successfully identified him based on other evidence.Meanwhile, police teams conducted searches in Shirur taluka’s sugarcane fields based on a tip-off but failed to locate the suspect.As the search continues, law enforcement officials remain confident of apprehending the accused soon.The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo motu cognizance of the incident and demanded immediate action. NCW Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar has written to the Director General of Police, requesting an action taken report within three days, along with a copy of the FIR.

Is Uddhav's Sena cozying up to BJP as Shinde plays guessing game?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-uddhavs-sena-cozying-up-to-bjp-as-shinde-plays-guessing-game/articleshow/118603780.cms,"NEW DELHI: The assembly election in Maharashtra is done and dusted. However, there is still never a dull moment in state politics with alliance dynamics and power equations between the many factions on both sides of the divide always at play. The latest in the 'Maha potboiler' is speculations around Uddhav Thackeray warming up to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) amid reports of rival Eknath Shinde's dissatisfaction within the Mahayuti.Uddhav's Sena, a former ally of the BJP who broke away from the alliance in 2014, is now showering praises on Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis . The latest in the list is Tuesday's editorial in Saamana, the Uddhav Sena mouthpiece. The editorial praised CM Fadnavis for ""taking away the powers” of ministers to appoint personal secretaries and officers on special duty (OSDs).The Saamana publication also took a dig at deputy CM Shinde alleging that fixers and brokers were fostered and had a free run during his tenure as CM earlier.The editorial claimed that Shinde had also 'complained' to the top BJP leadership against Fadnavis and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his fight against corruption.Earlier in January, Saamana had also praised Fadnavis for his visit to the Naxal-affected Gadchiroli district. The recent heaps of praises for Fadnavis indicates a fresh approach by Uddhav Sena who had earlier blamed him for splitting Sena by backing Shinde.CM Fadnavis is getting all this applause from the Uddhav faction amid reports rumbling in Mahauti camp and Shinde's discontentment which is said to have started when he was asked to take a demotion and given deputy CM post. Shinde's recent trips to his village, started soon after the Maharashtra assembly election results as the Mahayuti parties tried to chalk out government formation plans, kept raising eyebrows. The BJP, having the biggest winning share, of course, had the upper hand and Fadnavis was appointed the CM.While Shinde has rejected the reports of a rift with the BJP, his actions since the government formation speak otherwise.The appointment of NCP leader Aditi Tatkare and BJP leader Girish Mahajan as guardian ministers of Raigad and Nashik districts, respectively, brought tensions to the fore, with the Shiv Sena leaders expressing unhappiness. Shinde's Sena ministers Bharat Gogawale and Dadaji Bhuse were reportedly neglected for these posts and Shinde had left for his village in Daregaon.Both deputy CMs, Shinde and NCP leader Ajit Pawar, also set up project monitoring cells to track progress of projects in the districts of which they are guardian ministers and those of departments handled by ministers of their respective parties. As the CM already has his ""war room"" for monitoring key projects, this move was seen as both the BJP allies asserting themselves.Despite an existing CM relief fund for patient assistance in Maharashtra, Shinde also recently established a separate medical aid cell. He has consistently avoided participating in several meetings called by Fadnavis, notably skipping the Nashik Regional Development Authority discussion regarding the 2027 Kumbh Mela preparations. Instead, he conducted his own meeting in Nashik, which BJP minister Girish Mahajan did not attend.Following Fadnavis's review of the industries department, led by Shiv Sena minister Uday Samant, Shinde organised a separate assessment. Speculation about deteriorating relations intensified when the home department, under Fadnavis, reduced or withdrew police protection for 20 Shiv Sena MLAs, who had received security following the Sena division in 2022.Meanwhile, Uddhav's Sena while upping its attack on Shinde, has gone soft on BJP.In the 2024 assembly elections , the Mahayuti coalition of BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP won 235 of the 288 seats, with BJP securing 132 alone. Shinde's Sena secured 57 seats and Ajit Pawar's NCP got 41 seats.On the other hand, it was a disappointing show by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) which was hoping for a grand comeback. Uddhav's Sena got 20 seats, Congress 16 and Sharad Pawar's NCP secured 10 seats.The BJP, being the single largest party in Maharashtra, is not dependent on Shinde's party to keep the government afloat. With just 14 seats short, BJP is so close to majority that getting the numbers in its favour may not be difficult for the saffron party. In the numbers game, it actually does not matter to the BJP if it allies with Shinde, Uddhav, or for that matter, no one at all.It will be interesting to see if these moves by Uddhav’s Sena is a genuine case for Fadnavis or if the party is preparing grounds to explore a future tie-up with its former ally.","Uddhav's Sena, a former ally of the BJP who broke away from the alliance in 2014, is now showering praises on Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.

NEW DELHI: The health ministry has issued a warning against prolonged use of earphones and headphones, suggesting that these devices, whether wired or wireless, should not be used for more than two hours daily. If used for this duration, frequent breaks should be taken during listening sessions.In a letter to all states/UTs for further dissemination to the public, director general of health services Dr Atul Goel said recent studies have shown prolonged and excessive exposure to loud music and other sounds through personal audio devices can lead to irreversible hearing damage. ""Evidence has shown there is a temporary shift of hearing acuity (ability to hear and distinguish sounds) after prolonged use of an earphone/headphone or ear plug, which is generally a high-frequency hearing loss that is not easily noticeable in day-to-day life,"" he said.""If unsafe use of earphones/headphones/earplugs is prolonged and persistent, this shift of hearing acuity can be permanent and result in permanent hearing loss. Certain individuals may also develop a persistent ear ringing or buzzing noise called tinnitus because of prolonged unsafe use,"" the senior official said.The young population, Goel said, is at a higher risk due to unsafe listening practices. The rise of online gaming culture is also putting children at risk of exposure to the impulse of high decibel sounds, he added.""Once hearing is permanently impaired, normal hearing will never be restored by hearing aids or cochlear implants. Further, persistent tinnitus from a young age can lead to diverse psychological issues including but not limited to depression,"" he added.","The health ministry has issued a warning against prolonged use of earphones and headphones.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin Thursday alleged that attempts by BJP-led Centre to impose Hindi were only a facade and that the real intention was to spread Sanskrit.In his third letter to DMK cadres hitting out at Centre for its alleged plans to impose Hindi, Stalin contended that wherever a three-language formula was adopted, Hindi-Sanskrit had taken precedence. If TN too adopts such a formula, it will end up advancing BJP's Sanskritisation agenda, Stalin alleged.According to him, over 25 languages like Maithili, Braj, Bundelkhandi, Bhojpuri, Avadhi, Kannauji, Garhwali, Kumaoni spoken in various north Indian states were destroyed by Hindi-Sanskrit. Since Tamil fought against direct invasion, BJP wants to impose Hindi-Sanskrit through NEP, he claimed. ""Neither Hindi nor Sanskrit can ever destroy the greatness of Tamil. Fascists have always targeted a people's language and culture to erase their identity,"" Stalin said. He said the fact that Tamil survived without being corrupted by north Indian languages makes it a thorn in the flesh for those in power, forcing them to change their tack.Stalin said Sec 4.17 of NEP clearly promoted Sanskrit at all education levels, relegating Tamil and other languages to secondary status. Only in Sec 4.18, Tamil is mentioned. ""Even that says languages, including Tamil, shall be taught only in addition to Sanskrit.""""Push for a monolithic Hindi identity is what kills ancient mother tongues. UP and Bihar were never just 'Hindi heartlands'. Their real languages are now relics of the past,"" Stalin said.","Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin claims attempts by Centre to impose Hindi were only a facade.

"Science unified Ganga’s three separate streams, restored river’s course",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/science-unified-gangas-three-separate-streams-restored-rivers-course/articleshow/118607566.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maha Kumbh 2025 will be remembered for many things, but one engineering marvel stands out — the unification of the Ganga’s three separate streams into a single, cohesive flow. Through a 2.5-kilometre dredging project , the river’s course was restored, reclaiming land equivalent to 1,000 tennis courts. This first-of-its-kind intervention expanded the Mela premises by 22 hectares, ensuring better organisation and accessibility for millions of devotees.The Ganga had previously shifted its course, splitting into three streams that affected its purity and created logistical challenges for the Kumbh Mela. Officials noted that the uneven riverbed led to the formation of sand islands, making the task particularly complex. “We relied on advanced technology and our expertise in water body management to overcome what initially seemed like an insurmountable challenge,” an irrigation department official said.Anil Garg, principal secretary, irrigation and water resources department, highlighted the scale of the achievement: “This feat of reclaiming land equivalent to 1,000 tennis courts and expanding the Sangam nose to accommodate two lakh pilgrims at a time is unparalleled,” he said.This success was driven by a blend of technology, engineering, and human determination. “The project had to be completed within a two-month window from mid-Oct to Dec 31. We deployed three high-capacity dredging machines — two with a capacity of 250 cubic metres and one with 350 cubic metres — to remove over six lakh cubic metres of sand,” explained Gaurav Chopra, managing director of Cleantec Infra.Chopra also highlighted the unique challenges posed by strong river currents and fluctuating water levels. “To maintain stability, dredgers were anchored to pontoon bridges, allowing continuous 24/7 operations in shifts. Despite setbacks like broken pins and shifting machinery, the team stayed focused,” he said. With guidance from chief minister Yogi Adityanath and strategic input from IIT-Guwahati, an additional dredger was deployed to accelerate the work.The unified flow of the Ganga was successfully achieved just in time for Maha Kumbh 2025, creating a more structured and expansive Sangam area for devotees. This not only enhanced the spiritual experience but also ensured smoother logistics for the event’s large crowds.In addition to merging the streams, the project involved levelling and preparing the ground with five lakh metric tonnes of sand, making the Mela area more accessible. Officials and experts believe this project could serve as a replicable model for managing other water bodies across the country.","The Ganga had previously shifted its course, splitting into three streams that affected its purity and created logistical challenges for the Kumbh Mela.

BHOPAL: Nanaji Deshmukh 's concept of Antyodaya and Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay's "" integral humanism "" have been the twin inspirations for the Narendra Modi govt's welfare initiatives, home minister Amit Shah said in MP's Chitrakoot on Thursday.In just 10 years, the Centre, under Modi, has given basic amenities to 60 crore poor in the country, Shah said. Shah was in Chitrakoot in MP's Satna district to pay homage to Jan Sangh neta and Bharat Ratna awardee Nanaji Deshmukh on his 15th death anniversary. Shah also unveiled a statue of Jan Sangh co0founder Deendayal Upadhyay . It was Shah's second visit to MP in three days.""When the country became independent and policies were being framed, those who knew and respected India were looking at independent India's policies with a lot of sadness and concern. Be it our country's foreign policy, economic policy, agricultural policy or education policy - none of them had the essence of our ancient culture and the nation's soil,"" Shah said in his address.At that time, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay introduced the principle of ""Ekatma Manavwad (integral humanism)"", on how our economic philosophy, our foreign policy should be and the way we should look at the world, he said. ""That principle is taking India forward in the world today,"" Shah said.","Nanaji Deshmukh's concept of Antyodaya and Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay's "" integral humanism "" have been the twin inspirations for the Narendra Modi govt's welfare initiatives, home minister Amit Shah said.

MEERUT: Trilok Kumar died twice in six months. That is confirmed by official records from two govt institutions. The insurance payout came twice, too.Days after TOI uncovered an elaborate insurance scam originating in UP and running into hundreds of crores - where insurance agents, claims officials, panchayat authorities and even doctors and bank staff conspired and colluded to insure the dying and sometimes the dead - investigators now say the fraud runs deeper than initially thought. They say many more agencies and institutions are involved and that from the initial eight states from which they have nabbed some of the accused, they are now looking at ""12 states and counting"".They cited the case of Trilok Kumar in Delhi as an example. The first time Kumar died, it was cancer. That's what MCD records and receipts from the Nigambodh Ghat cremation office in Delhi showed. A resident of Shaktinagar, Kumar was cremated on June 19, 2024, with an official Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) document listing cancer as the cause of death. That should have been the end of his story. It wasn'tSix months later, an MCD death certificate surfaced, now claiming Kumar had died on Dec 27, 2024, at Govind Ballabh Pant Hospital. This time it was cardiopulmonary arrest. The paperwork was flawless- stamps, seals, signatures. TOI has the documents in its possession.""You can't admit a man who's already dead, run medical tests on him, and then hand over his body - all in a single day,"" said Sambhal ASP Anukriti Sharma, one of the lead investigators in a case that has exposed what police in UP are calling ""one of the most calculated and ruthless insurance swindles"" in recent memory.A senior doctor at GB Pant Hospital said: ""When a patient arrives in the emergency, we do not waste time on formalities. But if scammers convince a patient to provide a false name in exchange for money, with the promise of guaranteed treatment, there is a possibility that the patient may comply.""Sharma added, ""Since PMJJBY does not require thorough nominee verification, fraudsters took out multiple policies, waited 45 days, then forged death certificates to claim payouts. They used different names and took advantage of minimal checks.""Sambhal SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi said, ""We have arrested 16 people, including women, so far.""","Trilok Kumar died twice in six months.

BENGALURU: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Thursday warned against using the latest population figures for delimitation exercise, saying it would severely disadvantage southern states. He demanded that Centre clarify whether the exercise would be based on the 1971 Census, as was done previously, or on updated population data.""It is evident that if delimitation is carried out based on the latest population ratio, it will be a severe injustice to southern states. To prevent such unfairness, previous delimitation exercises were conducted using the 1971 Census as basis, following constitutional amendments,"" Siddaramaiah said in a statement.His remarks came a day after Union home minister Amit Shah said southern states would not lose a ""single parliamentary seat"" because of delimitation.However, Siddaramaiah dismissed this claim as ""untrustworthy"", suggesting it was either misleading or aimed at creating confusion. He argued that Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh had successfully controlled their population growth over past 50 years, while making significant strides in development. This was not the case with some states in north, he added.""As a result, if delimitation is based on the latest Census, southern states, including Karnataka, may see a reduction or stagnation in number of Lok Sabha seats, while northern states will gain more seats. In either scenario, southern states will bear the loss. Is the home minister unaware of this?"" he asked.Citing studies on the impact of delimitation, Siddaramaiah claimed Karnataka's Lok Sabha seats could shrink from 28 to 26, Andhra's from 42 to 34, Kerala's from 20 to 12, and TN's from 39 to 31, if the process is based on the latest Census. In contrast, UP's representation could increase from 80 to 91, Bihar's from 40 to 50, and Madhya Pradesh's from 29 to 33. ""If this is not injustice, what is?"" he questioned.Terming the move as ""unacceptable"", Siddaramaiah emphasised that either the 1971 Census should continue to be the basis for delimitation or the overall number of Lok Sabha seats should be increased proportionally. ""Looking at the extraordinary enthusiasm shown by Union govt for delimitation, it appears the real intent is to punish people of southern states for resisting his party's dominance,"" he alleged.The CM accused Centre of systematically undermining Karnataka's interests, pointing to disparities in tax distribution, GST allocations, disaster relief funds, and amendments to UGC regulations. He criticised BJP and JDS MPs from the state for failing to challenge these policies and remaining ""silent like slaves"".Siddaramaiah urged Kannadigas to set aside caste, religious and political differences to oppose the move, and said discussions were underway with other southern states to launch a coordinated movement against the proposed delimitation plan.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah warns against using latest population figures for delimitation exercise.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand HC on Thursday asked the state whether fresh suggestions should be invited and amendments considered for Uniform Civil Code (UCC). A division bench of Justices Manoj Tiwari and Ashish Naithani made the observation while hearing two petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the UCC Act and Rules. One petition was filed by activists, including Uma Bhatt, and another by a live-in couple. The court directed the state to file a counter by April 1.Advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the petitioners, argued the UCC creates an ""excessive surveillance regime, policing personal choices within the right to privacy ."" She contended that it establishes a framework for inquiry, authorisation, and penalisation of partner choices. The court asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta whether the state should reconsider its provisions.Chief standing counsel C S Rawat said the court orally asked the SG to request the state legislature to implement necessary modifications. Grover said the law, presented as a safeguard for women, could lead to harassment and social coercion.

Unilateral impounding of passport illegal: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unilateral-impounding-of-passport-illegal-sc/articleshow/118611906.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court used its exclusive powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to grant divorce to a man repeatedly assaulted by his wife in the US during a two-month-old marriage and quashed as ""illegal"" the decision of authorities to impound his passport after the woman lodged several FIRs in India against him.The ferocity of the assault prompted the man to call the police in the US twice within two months, after which the woman was charged with second-degree assault. They lived together for a total of 80 days - they got married on Feb 19, 2018 - before she came back to India and refused to return to the US.In India, she allegedly threw her mother-in-law out of the matrimonial home, forcing her to seek shelter in her daughter's house. She lodged eight cases against the man and his mother. The authorities, taking note of the criminal cases, unilaterally impounded the man's passport.The man then moved SC. A bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Sandeep Mehta found that the marriage was filled with acrimony and that there is no child born from the wedlock.Though the woman argued that she did not want divorce or alimony, the bench said the marriage appeared to have broken down irretrievably and that no useful purpose, emotional or practical, would be served by continuing the soured relationship. ""This is a fit case warranting the exercise of the discretion conferred under Article 142(1)..."" it said and ordered the husband to pay Rs 25 lakh as permanent alimony.Referring to the impounding of the man's passport on the mere ground that the woman had filed several cases in various courts, the bench said, ""we find that the impounding the man's passport under Section 10 of the Passport Act, 1967, was carried out without granting him an opportunity to be heard. This clear violation of the principles of natural justice renders the act of impounding the passport ex facie illegal"".","Supreme Court used its exclusive powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to grant divorce to a man.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has sought trial records of the 26/11 terror attack case from a Mumbai court in anticipation of Pakistan-born Canadian and ""key conspirator"" Tahawwur Hussain Rana 's expected extradition from the US.The court of principal district and sessions judge Vimal Kumar Yadav made the request on Jan 28 while hearing a plea by National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) for all documents relating to the case. These records had been transferred to Mumbai for use in adjudicating multiple cases linked to 26/11.A week earlier, America's apex court dismissed Rana's final appeal, clearing the path for his extradition. Previously, another court determined that he could be extradited to India for his alleged involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack orchestrated by Pakistan-headquartered terrorist outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).Rana is suspected to be one of the brains behind the coordinated terrorist assault across multiple locations in Mumbai that resulted in over 174 casualties. He was previously convicted in the US for supporting LeT. His alleged involvement includes assisting David Coleman Headley (alias Daood Gilani), a US citizen born to American and Pakistani parents. The latter was arrested in the US in Oct 2009.Based on investigation by US authorities, Rana knowingly supported Headley's connections to LeT and created a false identity for him to travel to India for reconnaissance ahead of the 2008 attack. NIA's investigation revealed Rana's role as a co-conspirator, leading to his arrest by FBI on Oct 27, 2009. He was subsequently charged under various sections of Indian law.Rana established the ""Immigrant Law Centre"" in Mumbai allegedly as a front and travelled across India with his wife Samraz Rana Akhtar in Nov 2008. He stands accused of being in regular contact with Major Iqbal, another co-conspirator, whilst carefully concealing their Pakistani connection. Being an army deserter, Rana received assurances of assistance through Major Iqbal via Headley.Headley secured a multiple-entry business visa to India, with Rana facilitating its extension. The conspirators chose Headley for his Western appearance and American background, with Rana providing necessary support to obscure the actual purpose of their activities.",A Delhi court has sought trial records of the 26/11 terror attack case from a Mumbai court.

""This court, in its writ jurisdiction under Article 226, will not enter the arena of disputed claims between the parties,"" said Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Neela Gokhale, asking them to seek civil remedy before an appropriate forum.In their petition, the 77-year-old mother and 48-year-old wife of the sadhu said M was the karta of a Hindu Undivided Family. ""Renouncing worldly affairs amounts to civil death of M and as such all his properties would devolve upon his other legal heirs, namely the petitioners."" M's son and daughter have also taken sanyas.He holds bonds worth about Rs 56 lakh and the date of maturity is Sept 18, 2026. As per RBI guidelines, the bonds are not transferable except in the case of natural death.Prior to taking sanyas, M sought to know from HDFC Bank the procedure for transmission of RBI bonds to his legal heirs. However, the bank did not accept sanyas as civil death and refused to transfer the bonds. After M took sanyas, his mother and wife applied to the bank, but it failed to transfer/transmit the bonds to them. HDFC's advocate referred to the bank's reply that there is no declaration of M being a karta. The date of maturity is Sept 18, 2026, and as per RBI guidelines, the bonds are not transferable except in the case of natural death. There is no succession certificate/probate submitted and no conclusive evidence to corroborate the claim that M and his children have taken sanyas.In their on February 21 order, the judges agreed with HDFC's advocate that ""whether M and his children took sanyas and renounced the world is a mixed question of facts"". They cited a Delhi HC decision that states 'the mere fact that a person declares he has become a sanyasi or describes himself as such or wears clothes worn by sanyasis would not make him a sanyasi'. Also, he 'must perform necessary ceremonies without which renunciation will not complete'.","Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Neela Gokhale asked them to seek civil remedy before an appropriate forum.

This was the largest train operation for any festival in the railway’s history. To run more passenger trains, all freight trains were shifted to the Dedicated Freight Corridors, officials said.Vaishnaw, who visited Prayagraj, lauded the seamless coordination between different departments. He said while the original goal was to operate around 13,000 trains, the railways managed to run 16,000 trains without any problems. “Every train operated effectively, guaranteeing devotees a hassle-free trip,” he said.Praising the efficient use of the Prayagraj junction area and the logistical arrangements, the minister said an example has been set and this can be emulated for future large-scale gatherings, including the upcoming Kumbh and Ardh Kumbh melas. “The experience gained during the historic Maha Kumbh will be of great help in managing future events,” he said.Officials said over 200 trains were put into service in the Kumbh area. These were either trainsets or had engines on both sides to avoid shunting operations. Vaishnaw said the railways undertook extensive infrastructural and operational enhancements across nine key stations in Prayagraj, adding second entry points, 48 platforms and 21 foot-over bridges to streamline movement.For better surveillance, 1,186 CCTV cameras were installed with over 100 having facial recognition technology. Drones were also deployed for crowd control. To manage peak-hour congestion, 23 permanent holding areas were created, while multilingual announcements were made and leaflets in 23 languages were distributed to passengers.

‘In Silkyara we could hear them, here it’s just silence’

Rat-hole mining: The ‘banned-practise’ that helped in evacuation of 41 workers from Silkyara tunnel

DEHRADUN: The tunnel has collapsed. Water and silt flood the narrow passage.Deep underground, there are eight men - trapped, unheard, unseen. At the mouth of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) in Telangana, hundreds of rescuers battle against time, fighting to bring them back.Also read: 48hr deadline set to trace missing SLBC workers in collapsed tunnel Among them are three men who have been there before - and done that. Though in a different catastrophe, high up in the hills of Uttarakhand.Over a year ago, they had stood at the opening of another collapsed tunnel, overseeing another desperate mission. Then, too, hope hung by a thread. A diary entry would perhaps read: Silkyara, Uttarkashi. 41 men, 17 days.In the swirling dust and tension, the men who once defied the odds in Uttarakhand are fighting to do it again in Telangana even as they admit the battle this time is harder.A senior supervisor from the Silkyara tunnel project, Shashi Bhushan Chauhan , now standing at the SLBC collapse site, told TOI on Wednesday: ""Life has come full circle for us."" The words hang heavy in the damp air, thick with the smell of wet earth and diesel fumes. His voice is hoarse with exhaustion. It was in Nov 2023 that Chauhan first became a footnote in history, working beside an auger machine in the race to free the workers trapped inside Silkyara's blocked tunnel.Also read: Water, slush and debris make the job tougher for rescuers This time, the crisis is different. The SLBC tunnel is narrower - just 33 feet wide compared to Silkyara's 45 feet. The tunnel boring machine (TBM) is stuck. Water and sludge keep pushing in. Communication lines? Non-existent. The men trapped in are silent. And silence is the worst kind of omen in a rescue mission. But Chauhan and his team - a mechanic and an industrial fabricator from the Navayuga Group - do not deal in omens. They deal in steel, sweat, and a deep, unspoken understanding of what it means to pull men from the earth before it swallows them.""The teamwork feels the same as it did in Silkyara - everyone pushing forward, driven by a single mission,"" Chauhan said. ""But there's one crucial difference. In Silkyara, we could hear them. We knew they were there, that they were holding on. Here, there's only silence. No voices, no signals, nothing. That uncertainty makes this even harder. We don't know their condition, and that makes every second feel heavier.""Another rescuer explains why this operation is even more challenging. ""The auger machine we used in Silkyara? That's not an option here. There's too much water, too much silt. The ground is shifting, unpredictable. We dewater, and more water rushes in. We clear the silt, and fresh sludge takes its place. Every step forward feels like one step back.""Hope, however, comes in the form of men who are built for the impossible. A six-member crew of ' rat-hole miners ', the underground warriors who crawled through Silkyara's debris to bring the last workers to safety, are standing by, ready to descend into the unknown again.""Our team arrived on Sunday. We're waiting,"" says Wakeel Hasan, their leader. ""When the moment comes, we go in."" No bravado, no unnecessary words.Just the quiet, unwavering certainty of men who have walked into darkness before and come out carrying lives.","Eight men trapped in collapsed tunnel in Telangana, India. Rescuers battle against time, fighting to bring them back. Among them are three men who have been there before - and done that. Over a year ago, they had stood at the opening of another collapsed tunnel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118587443,imgsize-915616,width-400,resizemode-4/118587443.jpg"

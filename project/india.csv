"Toll on under expansion 2-lane highways to be halved, partially opened e-ways to be on par with NHs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toll-on-under-expansion-2-lane-highways-to-be-halved-partially-opened-e-ways-to-be-on-par-with-nhs/articleshow/126297492.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a relief for highway commuters, toll on under expansion stretches — from two-lane to four-lane — will soon be halved during the construction period and the user fee on partially opened expressways such as Delhi-Mumbai and Amritsar-Jamnagar will be same as that of other NHs. At present, the toll on expressways is 1.25 times of other NH stretches.TOI has learnt that the finance ministry has given the green light to the two proposals from the road transport and highways ministry. The latter had proposed to halve toll during expansion of 10-metre-wide two-lane highways with paved shoulders to four-lane highways since commuters don’t get the desired service as the width of road gets reduced available while construction is underway.Currently, during expansion of a two-lane highway to four lanes, the toll charged is around 60% of the normal NH toll. With the concurrence of the finance ministry to the proposal, soon user fee will drop to 30% of normal toll during the construction phase. The finance ministry has asked the highways ministry to monitor and ensure strict enforcement of penalties on contractors for missing timeline in such widening projects.Officials said that while giving the go ahead for bringing toll rates on partially opened expressways on par with other NHs, the finance ministry said such relief should be for one year or till the expressway is fully operational, whichever is earlier. The highways ministry had submitted that vehicles, particularly heavy commercial vehicles, were not using expressways for higher toll rates.The finance ministry has said a decision on continuing this relaxation beyond one year may be taken based on actual uptake of traffic on such expressways. It has also asked the highways ministry to impose penalties on contractors for delay in completion of works.","The user fee on partially opened expressways such as Delhi-Mumbai and Amritsar- Jamnagar will be same as that of other NHs.

BJP Leader Attacks Shah Rukh Khan Over KKR's Bangladeshi Cricketer Amid Hindu Lynching in Bangladesh

.

NEW DELHI: Hindu religious leaders and BJP figures have launched sharp attacks on Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan over his IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) selecting Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman , while the Congress has stepped in to defend the actor, calling the remarks against him an attack on India’s pluralism.The first public criticism came from Hindu spiritual leader Devkinandan Thakur, who questioned KKR’s decision in the backdrop of reported violence against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. Speaking to ANI, Thakur said the KKR management should remove the Bangladeshi player. He demanded that the money paid to the cricketer be given to families of Hindu victims as an apology.""The management of KKR, their boss, should remove that cricketer (Mustafizur Rahman). Rs 9.2 crore that they are giving to that cricketer, that money should be given as an apology to the relatives of the Hindu children if they are in India, so that at least they can know that their feelings are with the Hindus,"" Thakur said.Spiritual leader Jagadguru Swami Rambhadracharya went on to questioned Khan’s character and called hhim a traitor.""He (Shah Rukh Khan) is not a hero. Shah Rukh Khan does not have a character.His actions have been those of a traitor,"" Rambhadracharya said.Soon after, BJP leader Sangeet Som called Shah Rukh Khan a “traitor” and accused him of investing money in a player from a country he claimed was “working against India”. Som said Mustafizur Rahman would not be allowed to play in the IPL.""The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there. Despite all this, traitors like Shah Rukh Khan, I'm calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shah Rukh Khan that they will not succeed. At any cost, they will not be able to get Mustafizur Rahman to play here. Rahman won't be able to step outside the airport,"" Som told ANI.The response from Congress followed soon after. MP Manickam Tagore condemned the remarks against Khan, calling them an attack on India’s pluralism. In a post on X, Tagore said hatred could not define nationalism and criticised the RSS for spreading division.""Calling Superstar Shah Rukh Khan a 'traitor' is an attack on India's pluralism. Hate cannot define nationalism. RSS must stop poisoning society.""The attacks come amid a series of violent incidents targeting members of the Hindu community in Bangladesh. Last month, two Hindu youths were lynched in separate incidents. Dipu Chandra Das, a garment factory worker in Mymensingh district, was beaten to death over alleged blasphemy charges on December 18, after which his body was reportedly hanged and set on fire.",Hindu religious leaders and BJP figures have launched sharp attacks on Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan over his IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders.

180 Kmph While You Sleep! India's Latest Vande Bharat Sleeper Marks New Era. Check Fares, Features

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will flag off the country's first Vande Bharat Sleeper train between Guwahati and Howrah later this month, barely months before the assembly polls in Assam and West Bengal. The train, marking a major upgrade in overnight train travel running at 120-130 kmph, will also reduce the travel time between two eastern capitals by more than three hours.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the first route of the indigenously built modern train that has a design speed of 180 kmph. PM is likely to visit Assam and West Bengal in the third week of this month. Responding to a question on the reason for choosing the route connecting two poll-bound states, Vaishnaw said the decision is part of PM's thrust on development in east and northeast India under the ""purvodaya"" scheme.The minister said that in the next six months eight more such trains catering to 1,200-1,500 km routes will be rolled out and by December this number will reach 12. ""From next year onwards, production will be ramped up rapidly as the entire supply chain will be in place by then,"" he added.Giving details of the first service, he said it will run six days a week and the one-way fare will be Rs 2,300 for 3AC, Rs 3,000 for 2AC and Rs 3,600 for 1AC travel.He added for the first time, the national transporter has decided to have a fixed rate of fare for each class of travel in these trains - Rs 2.4, Rs 3.1 and Rs 3.8 per km for third, second and first AC, meaning there will be no dynamic pricing. ""You will see several reforms in railways in 2026. This is one of them,"" Vaishnaw said. While passengers originating from Guwahati will be served Asamese cuisine, those starting from Kolkata will get Bengali food.On the special features of the train, Vaishnaw said the riding comfort can be compared with best trains across the globe and the AC system ensures there is adequate oxygen content in air to ensure passengers face no discomfort.Vaishnaw also gave details of progress made in fencing of tracks, upgradation of around 79% network and upgradation in the Over Head Equipment (OHE), the system of overhead cables, masts, and insulators that supplies high-voltage electricity to power electric trains, enabling trains to run at a higher speed. He added that with the expansion of railway infrastructure, they are hopeful of running more trains and they are hopeful of ending waitlisted tickets in some sectors in the next 2-3 years.","PM Narendra Modi will flag off the country's first Vande Bharat Sleeper train between Guwahati and Howrah later this month.

Gold stripped from Sabarimala through organised op: SIT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gold-stripped-from-sabarimala-through-organised-op-sit/articleshow/126296336.cms,"Sabarimala temple

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/THRISSUR: Gold embedded in sacred structures of Sabarimala temple in central Kerala was allegedly stripped, diverted and converted through a planned operation involving temple officials, intermediaries and private jewellers, a state-appointed SIT told a vigilance court.In a report seeking police custody of key accused, SIT said gold-plated copper sheets forming part of the sanctum sanctorum were removed in 2019 under the pretext of repairs, chemically stripped of gold at a private Chennai workshop and returned with fresh plating to conceal the loss.According to investigators, ornamental panels depicting 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu, zodiac symbols, the sanctum door lintel and the prabhamandalam (an arch behind the idol) were falsely described as ordinary copper sheets to secure their removal, causing unlawful loss to Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages the temple.SIT alleged criminal breach of trust, saying extracted gold was neither reported to devaswom authorities nor returned to temple treasury but treated as personal property. Arrests have been made and accused remanded in judicial custody, with SIT telling court interrogation in custody was essential to trace remaining gold and establish full chain of responsibility.SIT named former TDB president A Padmakumar, devaswom commissioner N Vasu, Sabarimala executive officer Sudheesh Kumar, administrative officer Murari Babu and others, along with Chennai-based Smart Creations CEO Pankaj Bhandari and Ballari-based jeweller Roddam Pandu Rangaiah Naga Govardhan.

Bengal this month

KOLKATA: Former Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh escalated tensions within the party after Wednesday's meeting with Union minister Amit Shah , questioning the electoral utility of ""mandir-masjid politics"" and taking veiled digs at ""recent entrants"" to the state unit.""Mandir-masjid issues do not impact poll results,"" Ghosh said Thursday, citing BJP's loss in Faizabad LS constituency in 2024 despite Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. He said it would be ""wrong to assume"" Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee could win 2026 assembly polls by building temples.Without naming anyone, Ghosh said, ""Everyone is a worker in BJP. Recent entrants have to prove their identity."" The remark was widely read as a swipe at politicians who joined from TMC before 2021 assembly polls.Ghosh met state BJP president Samik Bhattacharya and sought permission to campaign for three days in Kharagpur from Saturday, saying he wanted to contest his home seat in 2026 assembly polls. He also spoke openly about being sidelined: ""Baseless, agenda-driven theories were floated and I was isolated. I have told the central brass this. I am not afraid of getting lost. I have faith in them.""PM Narendra Modi will likely hold a rally in north Bengal in the third week of Jan and Union home minister Amit Shah is expected to visit Kolkata by the end of the month.

Accused not criminals but youth high on emotions: Court

AHMEDABAD: A sessions court refused to permit Gujarat govt to withdraw a criminal case against 19 Karni Sena activists, who were booked for vandalising a mall, torching vehicles and damaging property during their protest against the release of the film 'Padmavat' in 2018.The court said the alleged offence was committed ""to achieve personal interest and to maintain dominance of a particular community, ignoring the public interest"". It noted that the accused caused damage to the tune of Rs 16.4 lakh during the rioting. tnnKarni Sena's candle march on Jan 23, 2018, in protest against the movie event took a violent turn, with 19 participants being booked for rioting, unlawful assembly, arson, and criminal conspiracy under provisions of IPC, section 3(1) of Damages to Public Property Act and section 135(1) of Gujarat Police Act. After investigation, police filed a chargesheet and the case has been pending in a sessions court since 2019.The state govt first requested a JMFC court to allow it to withdraw the case under CrPC section 321, but the request was refused in 2022. It then approached the Ahmedabad (rural) sessions court and submitted that the decision to withdraw prosecution was based only on the interest of the public at large, and would be helpful in the administration of justice.The accused are not criminals but younsters who acted in the heat of passion and were high on emotions, it argued.However, additional sessions judge Hardik Shah said court can't permit withdrawal of prosecution merely because state govt issued an order to the public prosecutor. The court said the prosecutor did not apply his mind or express his opinion on the issue.","19 Karni Sena activists were booked for vandalising a mall, torching vehicles and damaging property during their protest against the release of the film 'Padmavat' in 2018.

New Labour Codes: The Ministry of Labour has pre-published draft rules under new labour codes on Wednesday. These draft rules are open for public consultation, and stakeholders have been invited to submit objections and suggestions within 45 days (30 days for Industrial Relations Rules). The government has clarified that during the transition period, existing rules will continue to apply until new rules are notified under the Labour Codes, as long as they are consistent with the Codes.Why are the new labour codes important? There are changes in the way provident fund contributions, wages, gratuity are calculated, along with a host of other measures. A uniform definition of “wages” now applies across all four Labour Codes and includes basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, with a 50 percent cap on allowances.

This clarification will help organizations estimate their gratuity liability more effectively,” he says.“Similarly, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Rules introduce important provisions on overtime and working conditions. Workers will now be entitled to double wages for any work beyond 48 hours in a week, and employers must ensure substituted rest days without exceeding ten consecutive working days. These measures aim to balance productivity with employee well-being,” he adds.According to Puneet Gupta, other notable provisions include annual medical check-ups for employees above 40 years in specific sectors such as factory, dock, mine, building & other construction work, creche allowances of at least Rs 500 per child where creche facilities are not provided, and journey allowances for inter-state migrant workers.Apart from the draft rules, the government has also published a list of FAQs on what the new labour codes mean, definition of wages, gratuity calculation etc.As per the provisions of Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897, old rules will remain in force till final notification of new rules under the Code, to the extent these are in line with Codes.The definition of “Wages” covers:As mentioned in Section 2(y) of Code on Wages, 2019, leave encashment is not a part of allowances.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.

Vaishnaw said that eight more Vande Bharat sleeper trains will be rolled out in the next six months, and the total will go up to 12 by year-end.The new train is scheduled to run between Howrah and Guwahati (Kamakhya). According to Indian Railways, the following districts will be benefitted:Ashwini Vaishnaw recently shared a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, showcasing the train undergoing high-speed trials on the Indian Railways network.During test runs conducted on the Kota–Nagda route, the Vande Bharat sleeper train achieved its top design speed of 180 kmph. A notable highlight from the trial was a stability demonstration in which glasses filled with water remained perfectly balanced without any water spilling even at over 180 kmph speed.“Vande Bharat Sleeper tested today by Commissioner ailway Safety. It ran at 180 kmph between Kota Nagda section. And our own water test demonstrated the technological features of this new generation train,” Ashwini Vaishnaw wrote in his post on X.Designed for overnight and long-haul journeys, the Vande Bharat sleeper train is the sleeping-class counterpart of the Vande Bharat chair car services already operating across the country.At present, two prototype rakes of the Vande Bharat sleeper train have been produced by BEML. Indian Railways is also gearing up for a broader transformation of long-distance travel, with plans to roll out more than 200 such sleeper trains in the coming years, supported by several ongoing manufacturing initiatives.BEML is jointly producing 10 Vande Bharat sleeper train sets in partnership with the Integral Coach Factory. Another batch of 10 sleeper rakes is being built by Kinet, a joint venture involving Indian and Russian entities. In addition, a consortium led by Titagarh Rail Systems along with BHEL has secured an order to manufacture 80 sleeper-class trainsets. Separately, the Integral Coach Factory is also developing its own sleeper configuration of the Vande Bharat train as an internal project.",The first Vande Bharat sleeper train will run between Guwahati and Kolkata. The train will be equipped with advanced bio-vacuum toilets similar to those used in aircraft. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to flag off the train in the second half of January 2026.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126284704,imgsize-101952,width-400,resizemode-4/vande-bharat-sleeper.jpg"

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry.

'India Will Be 3rd Largest Economy': PM Modi Sounds Warning To Trump, Says World is Betting on Delhi

India Becomes Fourth Largest Economy

High Growth, Low Inflation - The Goldilocks Situation

In a major feat, India has moved past Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy in nominal GDP terms, according to the government’s year-end economic review. Not only that, the Indian economy is set to overtake Germany to become the third largest after the US and China in the coming years. A final confirmation will depend on the data released by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the first half of 2026 when the final figures for 2025 will be released.“With GDP valued at $4.18 trillion, India has surpassed Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy and is poised to displace Germany from the third rank in the next 2.5 to 3 years with projected GDP of $7.3 trillion by 2030,” the government release said.India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now. The size of its economy has doubled in the last ten years, and it is now eyeing the position of being the third largest in the world.A government economic note issued late Monday highlighted that India remains one of the fastest-expanding major economies globally and is well placed to maintain its growth pace.IMF forecasts for 2026 value India’s economy at $4.51 trillion, slightly above Japan’s projected $4.46 trillion.The government’s optimistic outlook comes even as the economy faces headwinds following the imposition of steep US tariffs in August linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil.Recent high-frequency data signals that economic momentum is holding firm. Inflation has stayed below the lower bound of the tolerance band, joblessness is easing, and exports are showing steady improvement, the government review noted.Financial conditions also remain supportive, marked by healthy credit expansion to businesses, while demand continues to be resilient, aided by a further pickup in urban consumption.India’s real GDP expanded by 8.2% in the second quarter of FY 2025-26, accelerating from 7.8% in the preceding quarter and 7.4% in the final quarter of FY 2024-25. This growth was driven by strong domestic demand, even as global trade and policy uncertainties persisted. Real gross value added rose 8.1%, underpinned by solid performance in the industrial and services sectors.The Reserve Bank of India raised its growth projection for FY 2025-26 to 7.3%, up from 6.8% earlier. The upward revision factors in sustained domestic demand, rationalisation of income tax and GST, softer crude prices, an early push in government capital spending, and accommodative monetary and financial conditions, all supported by contained inflation.“Ongoing reforms are likely to further enable growth prospects. The present macro-economic situation presents a rare “goldilocks period” of high growth and low inflation,” the review said.CPI inflation stood at 4.26% in January and gradually moderated over the first half of the year, before declining further to multi-year lows during the latter half. Headline inflation continued to soften and touched historic lows of around 0.25% in October. This sharper-than-expected disinflation was primarily driven by a correction in food prices.RBI has cumulatively cut the repo rate by 1.25% this year, down from 6.5% to 5.25%. The move reflected a balanced approach between supporting growth and managing inflation, aided by a favourable outlook for both headline and core inflation.India’s external position continues to display considerable strength. Supported by healthy growth in services exports and a steady rise in overseas remittances, the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.3% of GDP in the second quarter of FY 2025–26, down from 2.2% in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, the government release said.Remittance inflows rose by 10.7% year-on-year during the quarter, reinforcing external stability. With services exports maintaining momentum and remittance flows remaining strong, the CAD is expected to stay contained through 2025–26.“India’s growth outlook remains buoyant, with global and domestic institutions upgrading their assessments on the back of strong economic fundamentals. Reflecting broad-based momentum across key sectors, the Reserve Bank of India revised its GDP growth projection for FY 2025–26 upward from 6.8% to 7.3%,” the review said.","India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now.

NEW DELHI: “You are a nominated official, but I am an elected representative … "" The Trinamool Congress ’s offensive against Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar has set the stage for an all-out confrontation over the ongoing Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls ahead of upcoming assembly elections in West Bengal. Mamata Banerjee ’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee , who led a Trinamool delegation to the Election Commission on Wednesday, accused the CEC of “losing temper” and “raising fingers at party members. Abhishek dared the CEC to respond to his allegations.""They think that by raising their voice and speaking aggressively, everyone will be silenced. When we started speaking, he began losing his temper. He tried to stop some of us and pointed fingers at me. I then stated that you are a nominated official, but I am an elected representative. You are answerable to your masters, but I am answerable to the masses who elected me, for whom we have come here to ensure that no legitimate voter is deleted from the list. .. If he has the courage, let him release the footage. I am standing very close to the ECI office,"" Abhishek said standing at the gate of the Election Commission office.""Gyanesh Kumar must be hearing what I am saying to the media right now. If he has the courage, he should come down, face the media, and rebut every point I am making, rather than making selective leaks after 8 pm.What is stopping him? Does he think the people of Bengal are his subservient? Apart from two-three questions, he has failed. Does he think the people of Bengal, and we MPs, ministers, and MLAs elected by the people, are bonded labourers or slaves?"" the Trinamool MP asked, targeting the CEC.Abhishek Banerjee’s dig on selective leaks referred to the party’s last meeting with the poll body on November 28. The Trinamool leader claimed that they had asked the Election Commission five questions in that meeting, but didn't receive a single precise answer to any of them. The Trinamool leader had accused the Election Commission of selectively leaking information to some journalists, claiming that they had answered every question.In return, the Election Commission accused the Trinamool of intimidating its electoral staff in the state.The Election Commission (EC) officials said that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) delegation was told that intimidation of any electoral staff by ground-level political representatives and workers will not be tolerated and that the West Bengal government should immediately release the enhanced honorarium to each BLO.Draft rolls for West Bengal released by the ECI in December show that 58,20,899 names, about 7.59 per cent of the electorate, have been provisionally deleted due to reasons such as death, permanent migration or untraceability. The Trinamool has raised concerns over the scale of deletions, alleging possible disenfranchisement.Also, around 1.36 crore entries have also been flagged for ""logical discrepancies"", while 30 lakh voters were categorised as unmapped – a significant percentage of whom are likely to be called for verification hearings. The timeline for final publication of electoral rolls in the state is February 14, 2026.Abhishek Banerjee questioned the list of ""logical discrepancies"" made by the EC and accused the poll body of weaponsing the voter list to help the BJP. The TMC leader demanded that the list of voters under the ""logical discrepancy"" category be published and the methodology and legal authority used to create this category be disclosed.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already claimed that the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise was a huge ""scam"" being conducted with the help of artificial intelligence, and has warned that her party will gherao the Election Commission's office in Delhi if the name of even a single legitimate voter is deleted from the electoral rolls.Trinamool Congress has said that it will not accept the final voter list if it has ""discrepancies” and if needed “it would fight it legally."" Clearly SIR, which is already in the centre of a political storm, is set for a rough ride in West Bengal with the Trinamool Congress piling unrelenting pressure on the Election Commission.",Trinamool Congress’s offensive against Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar has set the stage for an all-out confrontation over the ongoing Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls.

NEW DELHI: Getting into the Yuletide spirit could prove expensive for an Air India pilot who was to operate a Vancouver-Delhi (via Vienna) flight on Dec 23, 2025. A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement. The ultra long haul, to be operated by four pilots or two sets (one captain and a co-pilot in each set) in turns, supposed to leave at 3 pm local time did so with just a two-hour delay. The aircraft then landed in Vienna from where another set of crew operated it to Delhi.“AI has taken a very stern view of this matter. The pilot was flown to Delhi a couple of days later and is being probed. The issue has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is also examining the same,” said people in the know.While some sources say the pilot had inadvertently sipped an alcoholic drink at the airport and a staffer at duty free saw him doing so, others said he smelled of alcohol when buying a bottle.It is not yet known which of the two really happened, staffer reported the matter to Canadian authorities who then used CCTV footage to find out the pilot in question was to operate with flight. They managed to trace him to the AI aircraft.In a statement, AI said: “AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025, experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot’s fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry. In accordance with safety protocols, an alternate pilot was rostered to operate the flight, resulting in the delay. ”""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times,” the airline statement added.Pilots operating international sectors usually do not have pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests and the same is conducted on arrival as liquor is available on board these flights. This is to ensure they have not taken a sip or two during the flight. On domestic flights, pre-flights BA tests are conducted as alcohol is not served/sold on flights within India.While rules don’t mandate this, AI on its own has enforced a policy of conducting random pre-flight BA at international stations. The airline frequently keeps sending its doctors on international flights who then conduct these checks on pilots who are to operate the return flight to India.Pilots are surprised at this case. ""Forget drinking, we don’t even use after shaves, perfumes, mouth wash or homeopathic medicines some hours before operating a flight. There have been multiple instances of teetotallers failing BA tests because of the alcohol in their breath because of using toiletries with alcoholic content. We look for these items without any alcohol, except homeopathic medicines where possibly there’s no option,” said a captain. The reason: Failing BA test thrice means losing flying license.","A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle.

What the agreement says

Why the annual exchange matters

Historical context

Limits of the agreement

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad. The agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126285389,imgsize-1364220,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Canada has told Air India that one of its pilots was found tipsy just before operating a flight on Dec 23, 2025, violating the country's laws, and that the airline should investigate the case and inform it of action taken by Jan 26, 2026.Transport Canada sent this communication to AI a day after the pilot failed the breathalyser (BA) test and asked it to take ""corrective action"" under its safety management system ""to prevent any such recurrence"". This was first reported by TOI on Jan 1.Taking a serious view of the matter, AI has sought details of the BA test from Canada, including the level of alcohol found in the test, and has informed DGCA.""We were advised by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) that Captain *** reported for duty on Air India Fight AI 186 on Dec 23, 2025, while under the influence of alcohol, and unfit for duty. Two BA tests conducted by the RCMP at Vancouver International Airport confirmed this after he was advised to leave the aircraft. This incident indicates a contravention of Canadian Aviation Regulations by the operator (AI) and the crew member. .. as well as conditions outlined in Air India's Foreign Air Operator Certificate (FAOC 1946) issued by Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA). It is likely that enforcement action will be pursued by the RCMP, and by TCCA,"" says a Dec 24 letter from Transport Canada to AI.One of the conditions in AI's FAOC violated is that ""foreign air operator shall conduct a safe operation"". The letter adds: “In light of this, we request Air India to: conduct a thorough review and investigation under your safety management system and p rovide details of corrective actions taken to prevent any such recurrence. Please submit your response by Jan 26, 2026, outlining your findings and measures implemented and/or undertaken,” it adds.Due to closure of Pakistan airspace after Operation Sindoor, AI North America ultra long hauls now make a midway fuelling stop. AI 186 was to be operated by two sets of pilots - a captain and co-pilot in each set - from Vancouver to Vienna. From the Austrian capital, another set would have flown it to Delhi.""This pilot, who had a layover in Vienna, was reportedly buying alcohol from Vancouver Duty Free... The pilot was boarding from Canada and alighting in Austria, both foreign stations where most probably no BA checks would have been conducted. However a staffer at duty free smelt alcohol on his breath and informed police. Using CCTV, the police traced him to the AI flight ,"" said sources.Pilots don't have alcohol at least 12 hours before flying. ""In case someone has not been able to do so, they should refuse to operate a flight on medical grounds. Refusing the flight will save your job, your licence, and your career,"" said a senior captain.In a statement on Wednesday, AI had said: ""AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025 experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot's fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry.""""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy.

NEW DELHI: A Kolkata-based businessman weaved a web of 60 shell companies with drivers, house-keeping staff, office boys, junior staff and relatives as directors and created a fictitious turnover of thousands of crores in iron & steel manufacturing, all on paper with no real business activity involved, and swindled a consortium of govt banks of more than Rs 6,200 crore, with the head of one of the lead banks playing accessory.The scam was scripted by Sanjay Sureka, who created dozens of shell entities and with the help of S K Goel, then CMD of Uco Bank, managed to get loans of Rs 6,200 crore. ""Against loans of over Rs 6,200 crore, the company's liquidation value barely reached Rs 600 crore, and assets sold so far have realised only Rs 434 crore,"" ED has said in its investigation report.The entire operation was unearthed with Goel's arrest by ED on May 16 at his residence in New Delhi. The agency later identified properties worth over Rs 106 crore associated with family members and aides and attached them. Sureka and his associates were arrested in Dec 2024, as the agency started probing money laundering based on a CBI FIR against them.According to an ED investigation report, at the centre of this scam was Concast Steel & Power Ltd (CSPL) - once a flagship iron & steel group with plants across West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh - which was taken over by Sureka in 2008.Sureka conjured up the shell entities and with the help of Goel, who served as CMD of Uco Bank between 2007-2010, managed to get a total of Rs 6,200 crore in loans without interest and penalty.This money was laundered by the accused and quid pro quo to Goel was transferred in the name of shell companies that purchased properties on the bank CMD's behalf with the ownership of these firms later being transferred to Goel's family members.""It is a case study in how an entire financial ecosystem can be manipulated through fake turnover, circular transactions and system-wide blind spots, ultimately leaving public sector banks poorer by more than Rs 6,210.7 crore, excluding interest,"" a senior official said.The official further said 60 shell companies sprang up under the directorship of drivers, office boys and junior staff to help Sureka justify massive flows of funds.ED's investigation unearthed fake sales, purchases and transport billings where CSPL ""pretended to buy and sell iron and steel products"" with associated entities, backed by forged invoices, ledger entries, and transport documents. ""Fake transportation receipts were prepared to show trucks carrying goods between factories and shell companies, even though no truck ever moved, no goods were loaded, and no delivery was made. Yet on paper, CSPL looked like a bustling, high-volume operation with continuous production and sales,"" a source said.The probe further revealed that neither sale proceeds nor payments for purchases were made through banks, 99% of the transactions were merely book entries. Yet, during the entire operation lasting several years, it did not raise any alarm bells in the banks, which continued lending.""This meant Concast was essentially selling to itself and then realising these payments through accounting fiction. By 2017, the deception hit its peak - 99% of all sales to these entities were settled through book adjustments, not a single real rupee flowed in through the banking system,"" sources said.Purchases tell the same story. Over 50% of all raw material sourcing came from the same web of related-party entities. And just like sales, almost 90% of payments to these ""suppliers"" were made through internal adjustments - no real cash outflow, no genuine material movement, just rotating entries to manufacture expenses, inflate working capital needs, and justify massive fund withdrawals, the probe report said.","The scam was scripted by Sanjay Sureka, who created dozens of shell entities.

NEW DELHI: Soon all private vehicles like cars and bikes will have to get their fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS) for renewal of registration as it is in the case of commercial vehicles. The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, including this, through a draft notification to prevent the malpractice of vehicle owners managing to get fitness certificates even without visiting ATS or other testing centres. This also gains significance in the light of increasing concern over air pollution and fitness of vehicles.Fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles after attaining 15 years, and subsequently, in every five years.As per the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS, where these are established, for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says that “the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle” by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the specified tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass the fitness test, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared as ‘fit’ within 180 days from the first date of vehicle declared as ‘unfit’ the vehicle shall be categorised as ‘End of Life Vehicle (ELV)’ and flagged in the Vahan database as ‘ELV’.Officials said till now people used to get the timeline extended by simply submitting fees just days before the expiry of 180 days. “That won’t be possible any more. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure that any ATS doesn’t give incorrect test result,” said an official.",The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached a United Kingdom-based high-value property located near Buckingham Palace in a Rs 1,400 crore bank fraud case, the agency said on Wednesday.The property, valued at approximately Rs 150 crore, is being held under the beneficial ownership of businessman Nitin Shambhukumar Kasliwal and his family members.

This trust controlled a company based in Jersey and the British Virgin Islands, 'Catherine Property Holding Limited (CPHL)', which in turn held ownership of the said high-value immovable property in London,"" the agency said in a statement.During the course of investigation, ED has found that ""Kasliwal, through S Kumars Nationwide Limited, cheated the consortium of banks to the tune of Rs. 1400 crore and also diverted the funds outside India in the guise of foreign investments and thereafter acquired immovable assets outside India which were concealed through a complex structure of private trust and companies in foreign jurisdictions.""","The property, valued at approximately Rs 150 crore, is being held under the beneficial ownership of businessman Nitin Shambhukumar Kasliwal and his family members.

NEW DELHI: Medical aspirants seeking postgraduate admissions will get a wider choice this year after the National Medical Commission (NMC) approved 171 additional PG seats across medical colleges and directed counselling authorities to include them without waiting for formal permissions.According to a public notice, the 171 additional seats span key clinical and diagnostic specialties, including general medicine, general surgery, anaesthesiology, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, radiology, dermatology, emergency medicine, psychiatry, orthopaedics, respiratory medicine and pathology.Colleges across multiple states - including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Odisha, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Haryana - have received additional seats under the appeal process.In a notice issued on Dec 31, 2025, NMC's Medical Assessment and Rating Board said postgraduate seats granted by the First Appeal Committee for the 2025-26 academic year will be treated as valid for the counselling process. Counselling authorities have been told they need not wait for letters of permission (LoPs) from individual institutions to proceed.The additional seats were approved after medical colleges challenged earlier MARB decisions under provisions of NMC Act, 2019.These appeals were examined by the First Appeal Committee in meetings held on Dec 22 and 23, following which extra seats were sanctioned.The commission clarified that the list uploaded on the NMC website would itself serve as the valid document for counselling, ensuring that eligible PG seats are not lost due to administrative delays. Formal LoPs for the newly sanctioned seats, it said, will be issued shortly.Officials said the move is aimed at maximising seat utilisation while retaining regulatory oversight through the appeal mechanism. State medical education departments and counselling authorities have been instructed to act on the decision immediately.For thousands of PG aspirants, the approval offers additional opportunities at a time when competition for postgraduate medical seats remains intense.","The National Medical Commission (NMC) approved 171 additional PG seats across medical colleges.

Where Tigers Get Caught Between Faith And Tourism | I Witness

Testing human tolerance

In early 2025, a motion-sensor camera high on the hills of Purulia district, West Bengal, blinked to life. The image it captured was unremarkable in isolation: the grainy silhouette of a tiger crossing scrubland. But for residents and forest officials, it was extraordinary. Purulia had never yielded a tiger sighting before. No camera traps, no spoor, no local memory of the big cat. The photograph was more than a record; it was a signal - that the landscape had begun to shift in ways people were only beginning to comprehend.Within weeks, researchers traced the animal's path through a series of camera traps: March 2024 in Chhattisgarh's Balrampur forest division; summer sightings in Jharkhand's Palamau Tiger Reserve; and by January 2025, in Bengal's Purulia and Jhargram. The tiger had wandered roughly 500 km through human-dominated terrain, crossing administrative and ecological boundaries in search of space.The tiger's journey is not an anomaly. It is part of a pattern. India's wild tiger population, once on the brink of collapse, has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate - almost 75% of the world's wild tiger population. This rebound, often hailed as a conservation landmark, is the centrepiece of Project Tiger's story.Conservationists and forest staff took pride in the numbers, even as they now grapple with the consequences of unprecedented success.Scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) estimate that nearly 30% of these 3,682 tigers - more than 1,100 animals - now roam outside notified tiger reserves, sharpening the challenge of coexistence. WII director GS Bhardwaj told TOI that a dedicated Tiger Outside Tiger Reserves (TOTR) project has already been initiated from 2025, with the focus on conserving both tigers and people. The project targets forest divisions that host dispersing tigers, aims to mitigate human-tiger conflict linked to TOTR, and envisages strengthening protection regimes beyond reserve boundaries.But there is a paradox embedded in that success: Project Tiger became ""a little too successful"", as an expert said. As core reserves fill, tigers disperse farther - into buffers, across states and into human landscapes, fuelled by instinct, not intention. Tigers are inherently territorial; adults typically range across tens to hundreds of square km depending on prey and habitat. Studies in Indian landscapes have shown female home ranges between 30 and 64 sq km, with males sometimes exceeding 170 sq km. The average, even in prey-rich forests, often approaches 90 sq km.Bhardwaj said WII has advised all states to strengthen wildlife protection outside tiger reserves and carry out intensive monitoring of tigers moving beyond them, so that encounters do not escalate into human casualties or retaliatory killings.In the central Indian landscape - the broad swath of forests, hills and plateaus that includes Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and surrounding states - pressure is particularly acute. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, for instance, has one of the highest tiger densities in the country. A state-level review found territorial fights to be a major cause of death among tigers there between 2021 and 2023, reflecting intense competition for space and mates. With older males holding core territories, younger animals are pushed into buffer zones and near villages, raising the frequency of conflict. Bandhavgarh registers more than 2,000 cattle kills annually - a stark indicator of how tigers are pressed against the edges of ecological and social boundaries.Not all reserves exhibit the same degree of crowding though. In Uttarakhand, Corbett and Rajaji tiger reserves are approaching saturation, but nearly half of India's reserves remain below what scientists describe as their ecological capacity. Forest officials in the state have reported that Corbett can support about 20 tigers per 100 sq km, while eastern Rajaji's capacity is around 14 per 100 sq km - figures that help explain why animals increasingly stray outside protected areas.As tigers move beyond core forests, their presence ripples through local communities in palpable ways. In early 2025, in several villages in Uttar Pradesh's Pilibhit region, a prowling tiger caused schools to be closed. Children stayed home. ""Exams are coming,"" said a Class 5 student from Khalispur had then said, ""but we haven't even completed the syllabus."" Teachers refused to hold evening sessions. Parents stopped letting children walk alone. Tigers in Pilibhit often establish temporary bases in sugarcane fields, drawn by wild boars that feed on the sweet crop. Boars attract tigers. Sugarcane draws both. And between them lies the village.Elsewhere, the consequences have turned fatal. In Gadchiroli district of eastern Maharashtra, tiger numbers grew from zero to nearly 30 in five years - a startling shift in a landscape long considered tiger-scarce. With 12,000 sq km of forest, it appears generous on paper. But in practice, only about 7,000 sq km in two forest divisions is occupied. Human settlements, encroachments, and patchy prey base have constrained the actual carrying capacity. In 2024, 25 villagers died in tiger attacks across the Wadsa and Gadchiroli divisions. Two problem tigers were captured. A tigress was spared because she had cubs. Though technically capable of holding far more - by some estimates, up to 300 tigers - Gadchiroli cannot even accommodate 25 without triggering conflict.In one forest-fringe home in Jharkhand, a tiger entered a family's hut, settled on a wooden cot, and waited. The family, stunned, watched in silence from a corner of the room. The tiger had wandered far from mapped territory. Its entry was a mistake. Its departure, hours later, was quiet. Nobody was hurt. The event became a story of awe and fear.These tigers are no longer sentinels of wilderness. They are migrants. Monarchs in exile. Each one a ghost of ecological success, walking into fields, hamlets and homes - not out of aggression, but because the forests behind them are full.In some landscapes, officials speak of ""social carrying capacity"" - not how many tigers the habitat can sustain, but how many human communities are willing to tolerate. In parts of Uttarakhand, tiger-inflicted fatalities have surpassed leopard attacks for the first time in years. In response, village volunteers called Bagh Mitras have been trained to monitor tiger movement and alert forest departments. Some report sightings through mobile apps. Others simply listen for silence - the kind that descends before a tiger appears.Translocation - moving tigers from dense parks to underpopulated reserves - has been tried. Odisha attempted it in 2018, without success. Intra-state efforts show more promise, but officials now lean toward corridor consolidation. Movement is safer when it's natural. But for that, corridors must exist - not just on policy maps, but on the ground.In the Terai Arc, at least 10 critical corridors are under threat from habitat loss and development. In central India, linear infrastructure - railways, highways, power lines - cuts across migration routes. And yet, some reserves offer hope. In Tadoba, tiger density rose 30% over a decade, with buffer populations expanding as prey base improved. In Sundarbans, the reserve is being expanded by more than 1,000 sq km to create space for 101 tigers now crowding its mangrove heartland.India now has more than 50 tiger reserves. Some are full. Others still hold ecological potential, if prey can be restored. The key lies not just in creating new habitat, but in connecting the old - allowing dispersing tigers to move without triggering conflict.Perhaps the tiger today is not just an emblem of wilderness, but a kind of refugee of success - displaced by recovery. The Purulia tiger's trek is both a biometric trail and a metaphor. It is the story of a tiger with nowhere to go, walking east until the land gave way to politics and fear.In the empty classrooms of Pilibhit, in the living room of a Jharkhand family, in the cattle sheds of Bandhavgarh, and in the forests of Gadchiroli now marked by claw and memory, India's national animal is no longer confined to the forest. The tiger has returned. The question is - where can it stay?","India's wild tiger population has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate. As core reserves fill, tigers disperse farther - into buffers, across states and into human landscapes. Tigers are inherently territorial; adults typically range across tens to hundreds of square km depending on prey and habitat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126281010,imgsize-111780,width-400,resizemode-4/tiger-project-ntca.jpg"

Impact on Indian foreign policy

What next

NEW DELHI: As India reopens channels with China, five years after the violent Galwan Valley clash, the moment carries an irony difficult to ignore. The last time an Indian prime minister trusted China, what followed has been echoing in our ears, at least for the past decade.In 2025, India–China relations have taken an unexpected turn. After years of diplomatic frost, military standoffs, and hardened rhetoric, both sides have stepped back from the edge, at least on the surface. High-level engagements resumed, including Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s visit to Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. Talks on disengagement at sensitive friction points such as Depsang and Demchok were revived, commercial flights were restored, and limited trade channels reopened, catching many observers off guard.For a relationship long defined by suspicion, this thaw has raised as many questions as it has hopes.India–China ties are rooted in a long and uneasy history: the trauma of the 1962 war, recurring border confrontations, the Doklam standoff, and the prolonged deadlock following the Galwan clash of 2020. Against this backdrop, the question arises: how stable is this new calm, and what does it truly rest on?Just as important is what lies behind this shift. Strategic compulsions, economic pressures, and changing global alignments appear to have nudged both capitals towards a phase of managed stability, reset driven less by reconciliation than by necessity.For India, the sudden outreach to China marked a rare recalibration of posture. After years of projecting firmness and strategic distance, New Delhi’s decision to test a reset challenged long-held assumptions about Beijing. It signalled not abandonment of caution, but a willingness to probe whether limited cooperation could coexist with enduring rivalry, without compromising strategic autonomy or long-term security interests.The 2025 reset unlocked channels that had remained frozen by mistrust since 2020. Direct passenger flights between major cities, including Delhi and Beijing, resumed after a five-year pause, restoring people-to-people contact and easing business travel that had effectively stalled since the Galwan clash.On the ground, border trade routes also saw movement. Nathu La in Sikkim reopened, allowing the exchange of local goods. These measures helped lift bilateral trade, supported by a gradual easing of restrictions on select shipments and licensing procedures.Diplomatically, both sides revived long-dormant mechanisms, from special envoys to working groups on boundary issues, creating channels to manage friction without escalating tensions. While none of these steps amounted to a breakthrough on the core border dispute, they helped restore a minimum level of predictability to a relationship that had become dangerously brittle.India’s exports to China jumped sharply in November 2025, rising 90% year-on-year to $2.2 billion, according to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). From April to November, exports climbed 33% to $12.2 billion. At first glance, the figures suggested a revival in commercial ties after years of disruption.But the headline numbers conceal deeper vulnerabilities.GTRI notes that India’s export growth to China remains narrow and volatile, driven largely by a handful of products rather than a broad-based expansion of India’s traditional export basket. Naphtha and select electronics dominated the surge, while sectors such as iron ore and agriculture showed inconsistent or muted performance.At the same time, India’s imports from China remain heavily concentrated and structurally entrenched. Between January and October 2025, electronics alone accounted for $38 billion in imports, followed by machinery at $25.9 billion, organic chemicals at $11.5 billion, and plastics at $6.3 billion. These categories include mobile phone components, integrated circuits, laptops, solar modules, lithium-ion batteries, and pharmaceutical intermediates.The result is a widening trade imbalance. India’s exports to China fell from $23 billion in 2021 to $15.2 billion in 2022, remained subdued through 2023, and are projected to rise modestly to $17.5 billion in 2025. Imports, however, surged from $87.7 billion in 2021 to an estimated $123.5 billion in 2025, pushing the trade deficit towards $106 billion.Chinese customs data paints an even starker picture, suggesting a deficit of over $115 billion.India’s recent export gains to China are narrow, volatile, and heavily dependent on shifts in Chinese demand, GTRI warns. Without a sustained strategy to expand competitive manufacturing and reduce import dependence, short-term spikes will not alter the fundamentally imbalanced nature of the relationship.Many analysts argue that the 2025 thaw was driven less by renewed trust and more by shared constraints. As Ashley Tellis put it in one of his articles, “The India–China detente is more tactical than transformative, driven by US tariff pressures and trade deficits, not genuine border resolution.”For Beijing, mounting pressure from renewed US tariffs under President Donald Trump, a slowing domestic economy, and widening Western efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains made engagement with India increasingly attractive. Stabilising ties with a major regional power offered China economic breathing space and diplomatic signalling at a time of global pushback.For New Delhi, the calculus was equally pragmatic. Prolonged military deployments along the Line of Actual Control strained resources and readiness, while global supply chain disruptions underscored the costs of sustained confrontation with the world’s manufacturing hub. De-escalation offered room to regroup without conceding core positions.What emerged was a carefully calibrated detente, transactional, limited, and hedged, designed to manage risk rather than resolve rivalry.The durability of the 2025 reset remains uncertain. There is still no agreed demarcation of the Line of Actual Control, and troop levels have not returned to pre-2020 positions. Even minor patrol incidents could quickly spiral into larger crises.Deeper political sensitivities remain unresolved. The presence of the Dalai Lama in India and Beijing’s concerns over succession continue to loom in the background. China’s strategic partnership with Pakistan, particularly in the aftermath of terror incidents such as the Pahalgam attack, remains a major source of friction.Former Indian ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale told DW, “Beijing knows this. So does New Delhi. For example, India is never going to permit Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE into India’s telecom space again.”Without clearer ground rules and deeper strategic dialogue, many fear the thaw could remain temporary, vulnerable to the next shock.Opinions differ on whether India’s outreach to China reflects tensions with the United States or a broader recalibration. Beijing also recently rejected claims in a Pentagon report that China is easing border tensions to weaken US–India ties, calling such assertions misleading.For India, engagement with China fits a long-standing strategy of hedging, keeping options open, protecting strategic autonomy, and avoiding over-reliance on any one power. Strategic analyst Happymon Jacob, in an article, argued that the renewed bonhomie demonstrates that alternatives to exclusive alignment with Washington do exist.The reset has also improved India’s footing in multilateral forums such as the SCO and BRICS. With tensions temporarily eased, New Delhi will be able to engage more confidently, leveraging improved optics with Xi Jinping to press Global South concerns, development financing, and calls for a more balanced global order.At the same time, India can quietly continue to strengthen its neighbourhood strategy, deepening ties with Bhutan, expanding connectivity initiatives, and countering Chinese influence in Nepal and Sri Lanka.India now finds itself at a familiar but delicate crossroads. Over the past decade, it has sought to position itself as a central player in a multipolar world, balancing ties with the US and Russia while managing competition with China. This balancing act has become harder as global fault lines sharpen, forcing New Delhi to constantly reassess risks without locking itself into rigid alliances.Strategic analyst Brahma Chellaney, in an article, cautioned against overconfidence, warning that past experience shows how quickly tactical accommodation with China can unravel. History suggests that periods of calm in India–China relations often rest on fragile assumptions, vulnerable to sudden shifts triggered by border incidents, regional crises, or domestic political pressures on either side.Going forward, New Delhi will have to walk a tightrope. Military vigilance along the LAC cannot be relaxed even as diplomatic engagement continues. Economically, India must accelerate efforts to reduce critical import dependence, especially in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and clean energy components, while ensuring trade engagement does not translate into strategic vulnerability.The challenge ahead will be to preserve this fragile equilibrium: securing short-term stability without sacrificing long-term security, avoiding economic over-dependence, and ensuring that tactical resets do not harden into strategic illusions. For now, the 2025 thaw offers space, but not certainty.","After years of diplomatic frost, military standoffs, and hardened rhetoric, both sides have stepped back from the edge, at least on the surface.

India’s largest BOT highway project gets Cabinet nod; Surat–Chennai travel time to drop 45%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-largest-bot-highway-project-gets-cabinet-nod-suratchennai-travel-time-to-drop-45/articleshow/126275834.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Wednesday approved the construction of the 374-km greenfield access-controlled Nashik-Solapur-Akkalkot highway in Maharashtra, which is part of the Surat-Chennai high-speed corridor, at an estimated cost of Rs 19,142 crore.This will be the largest value of highway project on Build, Operate, Transfer (BOT) mode in the country’s NH development history, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.The cabinet also approved widening and strengthening of the 206-km Mohana to Koraput stretch of NH-326 in Odisha with an estimated cost of Rs 1,526 crore, which will improve connectivity to major economic and logistics corridors, and better last-mile access to Gopalpur port and Jeypore airport.PM Narendra Modi termed the decision of greenfield highway in Maharashtra as “building next-generation infrastructure development”. On X, he said, “This transformative project, aligned with PM Gati Shakti, will significantly reduce travel time, strengthen west-east connectivity, boost logistics cost, and create large-scale employment.” An official said this will emerge as an alternative to the existing Mumbai-Chennai corridor.Vaishnaw told reporters that the corridor will reduce travel time between Nashik and Solapur due to reduction in distance and allowing vehicles to drive at higher speed. The project will be completed in two years from the date of start of work. “Because of this corridor, the travel time between Surat and Chennai will be reduced by 45% from 31 hours at present to 17 hours. This will facilitate heavy traffic between Surat, Vadodara and Mumbai towards Kurnool, Bengaluru and Chennai,” he added.The project will be developed in two large packages of 152 km (Nashik to Ahilyanagar) and 222 km (Ahilyanagar to Akkalkot). The traffic estimate for this corridor is projected around 39,000 passenger car units (PCUs) per day. TOI has learnt that while for the first package, the govt may have to provide viability gap funding of around Rs 495 crore, the NHAI is likely to get annual premium from successful private highway builders.Responding to questions on how the massive project can be completed in just two years, officials said that the project will be bid out after getting 90% land and obtaining all approvals. “The land acquisition is at an advanced stage for the entire project,” said an official.","The 374-km greenfield access-controlled Nashik-Solapur-Akkalkot highway is part of the Surat-Chennai high-speed corridor.

South Haryana districts like Gurgaon showed significant lag in SRB

GURUGRAM: Haryana's annual sex ratio at birth (SRB), the number of girls born per 1,000 boys, climbed to 923 in 2025, the first time it has showed a gain since 2019.Alarm bells rang last year after it fell to 910, its lowest since 2016 when the 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' campaign was launched as a social campaign in a state with one of the lowest sex ratios in the country because of female infanticide.According to Civil Registration System (provisional) figures, the state registered 5,19,691 births last year, of which 2,70,281 were boys and 2,49,410 girls. Three districts reported an SRB of 950 or above, with Panchkula leading the state at 971, followed by Fatehabad (961) and Panipat (951).Karnal (944) and Yamunanagar (943) complete the top five. Sirsa (937), Nuh (935), Kurukshetra (927), Ambala (926), Hisar (926), Bhiwani (926) and Kaithal (924) were also above the state average.Health officials attributed the improvement to a series of crackdowns through 2025 against sex-selective abortions and sale of illegal medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) kits. An SRB of 923 is still low compared to other states but it's the highest Haryana has achieved. Over the years, the annual average has fluctuated, rather than held steady.South Haryana districts around Delhi, including Gurgaon (901), showed significant lag.Faridabad (916), Rohtak (898) and Sonipat (894) were among the weakest performers. Rewari (882) was placed at the bottom.Panchkula saw the most notable long-term improvement, from 909 in 2015 to 971 in 2025, despite dips in between, including a fall to 915 in 2024. Fatehabad, which was at 893 in 2015, climbed to 961 last year as did Panipat, which was at 892 in 2015. Gurgaon, despite its weaker performance compared to these districts, also saw an improvement from 858 in 2015.After the fall in SRB in 2024, a state-level task force was set up in March, with officers from health department, police, women and child development, AYUSH, National Health Mission (NHM) and the Food and Drug Administration reviewing SRB weekly.""A total of 114 FIRs were registered under MTP Act and 16 under PCPNDT (Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) Act in 2025. Ultrasound inspections nearly doubled from 3,072 in 2024 to 5,836 in 2025. Reverse tracking of abortions beyond 12 weeks among women with previous girl children was a key tool. From Oct 2024 to Dec 2025, 3,292 such abortions were reported through Asha workers, leading to 68 FIRs against clinics, chemists, peddlers and middlemen,"" said Dr Virender Yadav, director of NHM, Haryana.Crackdowns on abortion kit sales intensified. FDA sealed 44 chemist shops last year and registered 59 FIRs, including 17 for online sales. More than 6,000 kits were seized. The number of abortions carried out beyond 10 weeks fell from 21,498 in 2024 to 14,204 in 2025.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

Vanishing buffer

BENGALURU: Following a dispute mirroring the Aravalli controversy, members of a Supreme Court-appointed panel will inspect Bannerghatta National Park Friday after a plea against a 2018 govt move to cut the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Bengaluru's green backyard.The park is facing pressure from mining and real estate interests eyeing its contiguous landscape. At the core of the standoff is govt's move to drastically shrink ESZ from 268.9sqkm to 168.8sqkm and curtail its width from 4km to just 1km.A group of citizens and activists led by K Belliappa had approached Supreme Court in May 2025, arguing the reduction undermines the purpose of an ESZ. On Friday, members of the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee (CEC), led by Chandra Prakash Goyal, will survey the park and speak to senior Karnataka officials, including the chief secretary, to assess the ecological impact of the reduction.In a preliminary notification in June 2016, the Union environment ministry had in consultation with the state proposed declaring 268.9sqkm around BNP as ESZ. However, the final notification of Nov 2018 sharply curtailed the protected area - a decision the petitioners alleged was influenced by real estate developers and mining and quarrying interests. They contended that several ecologically sensitive pockets surrounding well-documented elephant corridors were excluded from the final notification.Kiran Urs, a member of the Bannerghatta Nature Conservation Trust (BNCT), said ESZ reduction appeared to be an attempt to legitimise existing ecological violations. ""The pockets excluded from the final notification contain active quarries, and there were efforts to build a township along the boundary, which will inevitably exert immense pressure on the ecosystem,"" Urs alleged.Somashekhar, a farmer from Kaduchikkanahalli near the park, claimed he came under pressure to sell his land even after the final ESZ notification. ""However, I continue to hold my land and grow ragi,"" he said. Keerthan Reddy of BNCT described the park as one of the best ecological gifts for a burgeoning Bengaluru. ""No other city can boast this vast green landscape in its backyard, dotted with a salubrious population of tigers, elephants, leopards, and countless other species of flora and fauna. The city is already witness to rising incidents of human-animal conflict, and violations like these would only add to the problem,"" Reddy cautioned.",Supreme Court-appointed panel will inspect Bannerghatta National Park Friday.

RTI replies accessed by TOI show that 1,600 of 4,099 faculty positions - about 39% - are lying vacant, raising concerns about the impact on patient care, specialist services and medical education.The data, compiled from RTI responses received from 11 All India Institute of Medical Sciences across different states, point to a widespread shortage cutting across both older, established AIIMS and newer institutes.At AIIMS Delhi - the country's oldest and largest AIIMS and a national referral centre for complex cases - 524 faculty posts are vacant out of a sanctioned strength of 1,306, across key departments such as medicine, surgery, anaesthesia, paediatrics, neurology, oncology and emergency care.Several newer AIIMS are facing even higher shortages. AIIMS Jodhpur is worst hit, operating with 46.7% of faculty posts vacant (189 of 405).AIIMS Gorakhpur follows with 45.5% vacancies, while AIIMS Jammu reports a 44.3% shortfall. More than 40% of posts are also unfilled at AIIMS Kalyani and AIIMS Bilaspur. AIIMS Nagpur has 137 vacant posts out of 373 sanctioned positions, amounting to 36.7% vacancies.Other institutes show relatively lower - but still significant - shortages. AIIMS Bathinda is short of 37.4% of its faculty strength, AIIMS Raipur 34.8%, AIIMS Bhubaneswar 26%, and AIIMS Bhopal 25.6%.Health experts warn that prolonged faculty shortages at teaching hospitals affect outpatient services, surgery schedules, ICU supervision and the training of undergraduate and postgraduate doctors, as senior faculty juggle clinical, academic and administrative roles.Responding to staffing concerns, Rima Dada, media cell in-charge at AIIMS Delhi, said recruitment efforts were ongoing.

Strict action against those who didn’t follow instructions: Mayor

INDORE: Madhya Pradesh's govt late Thursday evening confirmed nine deaths in Bhagirathpura following people falling ill after drinking contaminated water.People from the area had started pouring into hospitals across the city complaining of diarrhoea and vomiting since Monday after the drinking water supply to Bhagirathpura was contaminated with sewage water from a toilet built at the local police check post.Additional chief secretary Sanjay Dubey, in charge of the urban development department, told TOI: ""Nine deaths have been reported in the area. But we can at present attribute only four to the contaminated water based on postmortem examination reports."" Indore district collector Shivam Verma said the initial report of tests on water samples from Bhagirathpura, received late Thursday evening, found the water to be ""contaminated. "" He, however, could not confirm the type of bacteria found.Dubey, meanwhile, met top officials in Indore to chalk out the course of action. “We have worked out guidelines to ensure that funds are allocated and treatment costs of patients are taken care of,” Dubey said. MP CM Mohan Yadav had announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh for each victim’s family. Chief medical and health officer Dr Madhav Prasad Hasani said on Thursday that 1,714 houses were surveyed and 8,571 people were examined.Of these, 338 patients were identified and treated on the spot.Till Thursday, 272 patients had been admitted to hospitals, of which 71 patients have been discharged. There were 201 patients currently in hospitals and 32 in the ICUs.During the meeting, Dubey discussed ways to contain the situation on the ground and ensure safe water supply. “Instructions issued on various works related to water and sewerage were not followed properly and strict action should be taken against those responsible,” Indore mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava said.MP urban development and housing minister Kailash Vijayvargiya, however, said, “Around 60% of old pipelines have been changed. Work on the rest is on.”Earlier in the day, officials visited the site and checked the water supply pipelines. “Water supply was re-started on Thursday. But we did not allow residents to use it. Water samples were taken randomly. They will be tested on alternative days. Only after the samples are cleared will residents be allowed to consume that water,” Dubey said.The tragedy has also prompted authorities to consider taking steps in civic bodies across the state to prevent such incidents. “We will come out with a standard operating procedure to ensure that random water sample collection is carried out in all local bodies to ensure clean water supply,” he said.Vijayvargiya met the affected families and assured them of govt support. “No person and family affected by this outbreak will suffer. A list of those who were admitted to hospitals has been drawn up and treatment costs will be met. Their expenses will be returned to them via cheques,” Vijayvargiya said.MP Congress president Jitu Patwari, meanwhile, criticised BJP-led state govt over the deaths, saying the tragedy was the result of “gross negligence and arrogance of power”. Congress claimed 13 people had died. “This tragedy has occurred due to govt’s negligence and insensitivity. When journalists raise questions, ministers abuse them. This is not democracy but dictatorial thinking,” he said.",People from the area had started pouring into hospitals across the city complaining of diarrhoea and vomiting since Monday.

INDORE: A deathly silence prevails in Bhagirathpura area of Indore. Barring a few people at makeshift medical camps, its lanes are empty. With over 200 people from the area admitted in as many as 27 hospitals across the city after being afflicted with diarrhoea, most residents have been away attending to the ill since Monday night when they began vomiting and developed high fever. Nine persons have died till now.Tragedy struck Bhagirathpura when a pit to clear waste from a toilet built at the local police check post began leaking, leading to the waste water mixing with the main water supply line that ran just beneath it. Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) officials said the contractor had channeled the output from the toilet to a pit above the main water supply line rather than constructing a septic tank and connecting it to the sewage line.On Thursday, even as Madhya Pradesh govt officials scrambled to fix responsibility, spruce up treatment facilities, and clean up the water supply system, Sadhana Sahu, a teacher at a private school, sat on the doorstep of her home in Bhagirathpura and wept uncontrollably. She has lost her six-month-old son. ""Abhyan was born 10 years after we had a daughter. Bas, mera bachcha nahin raha (My child is no more),"" Sadhana said.Abhyan's father, Sunil Sahu, who works from home for an internet firm, said, ""He had diarrhoea and fever. We took him to a doctor on Dec 26. We brought him back home after he was prescribed medicines. He was fine the next two days but suddenly developed high fever, vomited, and died at home on Monday. We couldn't even take him to a hospital.""""The contaminated water caused his death. I had mixed water with his milk and his health deteriorated,"" Sadhana said.Wailing could be heard from some of the homes where death had struck. Almost every household in Bhagirathpura - which has a population of about 15,000, most from economically weak sections living cheek-by-jowl - has one or more people afflicted.""We earn little and barely manage to survive,"" said Alguram Yadav of Borasi ki Gali. His wife Urmila, 65, died on Sunday. His son Sanju, daughter-in-law Roshini and grandson Shivam (11 months) are admitted to hospitals with the same symptoms that took Urmila's life.""Nobody had turned up to help, though some administrative officials came to check. Kailash-ji (state minister Kailash Vijayvargiya) came to hand over a Rs 2 lakh cheque as compensation, announced by the CM on Wednesday"" he said.",Tragedy struck Bhagirathpura when a pit to clear waste from a toilet built at the local police check post began leaking.

"Videos, automated tests to tackle vehicle fitness fraud",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/videos-automated-tests-to-tackle-vehicle-fitness-fraud/articleshow/126293994.cms,"Vehicle fitness fraud

NEW DELHI: The malpractice of getting fitness certificates, including PUC, home-delivered without taking vehicles to test centres for renewal of registration will soon be a thing of the past.In a draft notification proposing major changes in motor vehicle rules, the transport ministry has proposed to make it mandatory for private vehicles to get fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS). The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10-second geo-tagged video of the vehicle at the time of the fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key chan-ges in the central motor vehicle rules through a draft notification. This gains significance in light of increasing concern over air pollution. A fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles over 15 years old, and subsequently, every five years.According to the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says ""the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 second geo-tagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle"" by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared 'fit' within 180 days from the first date of being deemed 'unfit', it shall be categorised as 'End of Life Vehicle (ELV)' and flagged in the Vahan database as 'ELV'.Officials said people got their timeline extended by simply submitting fees before expiry of 180 days. ""That won't be possible. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure any ATS doesn't give incorrect test result,"" said an official.","The road transport ministry has proposed key chan-ges in the central motor vehicle rules through a draft notification.

I am confident that DRDO will work wholeheartedly to achieve this goal soon,” Singh said.The minister praised DRDO for becoming trust builders along with technology creators, which makes people look towards it with hope, certainty, and belief.

From procurement to project management, from industry engagement to collaborating with start-ups and MSMEs, there is a visible effort to make the work easier, faster, and more reliable,” he said.Singh said, “The world is changing every day. Technology, innovation and new warfare domains are rapidly advancing, making yesterday’s knowledge obsolete. We must never assume that the learning process has ended. We must continue learning and challenge themselves, paving the way for the new generation.”He was apprised of the major targets set for 2026 and various reforms that the DRDO is taking for the betterment of the organisation.",Defence minister Rajnath Singh visited the DRDO headquarters on its 68th foundation day.

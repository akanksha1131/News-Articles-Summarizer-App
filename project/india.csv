Karnataka high court: Hospital name change can’t be grounds to deny reimbursement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-hosp-name-change-cant-be-grounds-to-deny-reimbursement/articleshow/123890799.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: Karnataka HC’s Dharwad bench slammed state government for using bureaucratic red tape to deny medical reimbursement, ruling that an associate professor’s claim of nearly Rs 14 lakh could not be rejected simply because a hospital changed its name.Justice Suraj Govindaraj called the denial “arbitrary and legally unsustainable” after authorities refused to reimburse Shivanandappa Doddagoudar, associate professor at a government first-grade college in Haveri’s Ranebennur. His treatment at Kasturba Medical College Hospital, Manipal, was rejected on grounds that the institution later updated its name to Kasturba Hospital, Manipal.Doddagoudar said the hospital was on govt’s approved list under Karnataka Government Servants (Medical Attendance) Rules, 1963. The hospital formally sought a name correction in March 2021. Despite the request, officials failed to update the recognised list and rejected reimbursement claims.The state higher education department and Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust had contended that only hospitals listed under their exact names could qualify and any deviation was unacceptable.Justice Govindaraj disagreed, saying the hospital had already been vetted and approved: “Mere change of nomenclature did not alter the hospital’s identity or services.” The court has directed higher education department to reconsider the reimbursement claim within six weeks.",Karnataka HC’s Dharwad bench slammed state government for using bureaucratic red tape to deny medical reimbursement.

Charlie Kirk's Murder Triggers Nationalist Protest In London; Tommy Robinson's Rally Turns Violent

Poll Do you believe that the UK government should take stricter measures against illegal immigration? Yes, absolutely No, it should be more lenient

Anti-migrant focus



Flags and slogans







London’s streets turned into a stage for Britain’s anxieties on Saturday, as far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew a crowd count in six figures for the anti immigrant ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally. Tens of thousands of people marched, leading to sporadic clashes with police.The marchers came to London by train and coach for what was called a ""festival of free speech,"" but speeches during the event spread racist conspiracy theories and anti-Muslim comments across Whitehall, The Guardian reported.Police said some officers were punched, kicked, and hit by bottles thrown from the edges of the ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally. More than 1,000 officers were deployed, with reinforcements in helmets and riot shields sent in when needed, as per a report by news agency Associated Press.According to police, the crowd count was estimated at 1,10,000 to 1,50,000 people, much larger than expected. However, it was still smaller than the pro-Palestinian march in November 2023 that drew a crowd count of about 300,000 people.A rival protest, the ""March Against Fascism"" organized by Stand Up To Racism, attracted a crowd count of around 5,000 participants.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founded the English Defense League and is one of the most prominent far-right figures in Britain.The march was presented as a defense of free speech. However, much of the messaging from speakers, including far-right politicians from Europe, centered on migration.""We are both subject to the same process of the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture, you and we are being colonized by our former colonies,"" French politician Eric Zemmour said.Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and owner of X, joined by video and criticized the UK government. ""There’s something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion, but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration,"" he said.Robinson told the crowd that migrants had more rights in court than the ""British public, the people that built this nation.""The rallies come amid political debate in the UK over migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats without authorization. This summer saw several anti-migrant protests outside hotels housing asylum-seekers, following the conviction of an Ethiopian man for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in London. Some of these protests turned violent and led to arrests.At the ""Unite the Kingdom"" march, participants carried St George’s flags and the union jack and chanted ""we want our country back.""Flags have become more common across the UK in recent months, with some viewing them as national pride and others as a sign of growing nationalism.Protesters held placards saying ""stop the boats,"" ""send them home,"" and ""enough is enough, save our children.""Counter-protesters carried signs that read ""refugees welcome"" and ""smash the far right,"" while chanting ""stand up, fight back.""Robinson’s supporters also shouted crude remarks about UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and expressed support for slain US conservative activist Charlie Kirk.","Far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew a crowd count in six figures for the anti immigrant ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally.

The gust of boycott wind around the India vs Pakistan Asia Cup clash has made its way into the Indian dressing room.TimesofIndia.com can confirm that the players had a long conversation with head coach Gautam Gambhir and other support staff, with questions swirling far beyond the boundary rope.The players have been told to stay professional and take the match just like any other. But can they?It is a young team, with most of the cricketers keeping tabs on social media the moment they get their phones back after an intensive net session. They are professionals, but they too were shaken during the border skirmish between the two countries in May, and now with the calls for boycott in the backdrop.Also See: IND vs PAK Live Score, Asia Cup 2025 The tension can be sensed, as ahead of a big match like this, neither the head coach, captain nor any player came for the pre-match press conference.On the eve of the match, India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate was asked if players would be carrying the sentiments of a wounded public.He replied: ""Yes, I think they will.""It is a very sensitive issue. I have no doubt the players share the compassion and feelings of the vast majority of the Indian public. The Asia Cup was in limbo for a long period of time and we were just waiting.""We didn’t think we were going to be coming at one stage. But obviously, you know what the government’s stance is.Now the team, particularly the players, have to put their sentiments and emotions behind,"" he added.The Dutch coach later admitted that the team did go into a huddle on Saturday and addressed the situation in the team meeting.""We’re aware of people’s feelings. At the same time, we will put it behind us and the guys will get a chance to play for their country again tomorrow. They will be as professional and focused as they can be given the circumstances,"" he said.Ryan ten Doeschate discovered how India vs Pakistan begins long before the first ball.His face often slipped into a void of expression, his silences dragging longer than comfort allowed, each word measured as if it carried the weight of a landmine. In real time, he was discovering that India-Pakistan cricket is never merely a game; it is a battlefield disguised as sport.""I guess the other side of the argument is that you separate sport from politics, and people have got different opinions on that. Hopefully the way we play can represent how we feel about the country,"" he said.""I understand the position and, like I explained, the sentiment, but we are following the direction of what the BCCI and the Indian government have decided is right for the country at the moment.""This will be ten Doeschate’s second India-Pakistan match. It was in Dubai that he first tasted the rivalry during the Champions Trophy earlier this year.When coaxed about whether there was anything different in preparation, he said:""I will be honest, no. I was expecting a lot more needle during the Champions Trophy game, and I didn’t really feel that either. The preparation or focus hasn’t been any different to any other important game. Pakistan has also started to come to terms with how they want to play T20 cricket. So it’s going to be a slightly different challenge compared to the last 24 months. We want to focus on what we are doing and how we want to play.""Ten Doeschate had survived the press conference, and before signing off, revealed coach Gautam Gambhir’s message to his team ahead of the clash.""We obviously are aware of the sentiments and the strong feelings. And Gauti’s message has just been very professional about not worrying about things that are not in our control.""Just trying to be emotionless when approaching the cricket side of things. The guys are professional enough now. I’m sure individuals have different levels of feeling on the spectrum of where they feel the whole situation is. But the messaging has been to just focus on the cricket and try to just focus on the one game tomorrow.""Whoever wins the match on Sunday, one thing is for sure: the India-Pakistan rivalry has been reignited. Yes, it has lost some flair; the cricket is trying to serve as a stage, but the play is stretching far beyond it.",India face Pakistan in the Asia Cup on Sunday in Dubai.

Moscow on Sunday praised its longstanding relationship with Delhi, describing it as “reliable and steadily progressing” and warning that any effort to disrupt the partnership is “destined to fail. ”The Russian foreign ministry welcomed India’s commitment to continue and expand multifaceted cooperation with Russia, despite pressure from US President Donald Trump to impose US-like tariffs on Indian goods for continuing to buy Russian oil.Officials added that “frankly, anything else would be hard to imagine,” as quoted by RT International.The ministry highlighted that New Delhi’s approach, despite Western criticism, reflects “the spirit and traditions of long-standing Russia-India friendship” and embodies what it called “strategic autonomy in international affairs.”Moscow emphasised that the partnership between Russia and India is based on “the highest value of sovereignty and the primacy of national interests,” making the relationship “reliable, predictable and truly strategic in nature.”Officials noted that the two countries are engaged in large-scale joint projects across various fields, including civilian and military production, manned space missions, nuclear power, and Indian investments in Russian oil exploration projects.The ministry also highlighted ongoing cooperation on payment systems, expanding the use of national currencies, and creating alternative transport and logistics routes. These initiatives are described as long-term efforts and not merely a response to “unfavorable geopolitical realities.”The comments come amid rising tensions with the United States, which last month imposed unprecedented duties on most Indian products, including an initial 25% tariff and an additional 25% “penalty” for Indian purchases of Russian oil and defense equipment.US officials claimed India’s energy imports from Russia have indirectly fueled the Ukraine conflict. India rejected these accusations, calling Washington’s move “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.”The US measures also followed stalled efforts to reach a bilateral trade deal. While officials confirmed this week that negotiations have restarted, earlier reports suggested India was refusing to give concessions on agriculture and dairy, areas it regards as “very big red lines.”","Russian foreign ministry welcomes India's commitment to continue cooperation with Russia.

Mystery of Agatha Christie's India story finally solved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-of-agatha-christies-india-story-finally-solved/articleshow/123877784.cms,"Agatha Christie autographs copies of her books

WHY DIDN’T THEY ASK MATHEW? There was constant speculation over whether Agatha Christie ever came to India, but never any proof, even though she was known to be an avid traveller. Now, her grandson tells writer Manjiri Prabhu that she definitely had visited — not once, but twice

Mathew Prichard (also in photo right), who’s settled the India question once and for all, with his grandmother Agatha Christie

The following are extracts from two letters that Christie wrote to Edmund Cork in Cyprus, her literary agent and lifelong friend.

Jan 11, 1960 |

Jan 20, 1960 |

Another letter was from Christie, then staying at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi, to Rosalind, her daughter.

Feb 16, 1960 |

Oct 30, 1961 |

From Delhi, she wrote again to Rosalind.

Some mysteries need to be actively cracked, but some solve themselves with time.There has been constant speculation about Agatha Christie’s India connection. One question has recurred over the years, but has never really been accurately answered: did Agatha Christie ever visit India? The internet and popular belief will state that she did not. I, too, had often puzzled over how Christie, a world traveller, had never actually been to India. In fact, in a video in 2021, I had even concluded that she indeed hadn’t.Until one cool but sunny Easter day in Wales.In March 2024, I met Christie’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, and his lovely wife Lucy, at their charming home in Wales. Prichard, now in his 80s, had been very close to his grandmother.It was a memorable day, but it turned momentous when Mathew showed me Christie’s personal memorabilia — her passports, her first typed and edited manuscripts, rare photos, her camera, and her last portrait painting, which hung on one of the walls of his house.When Mathew signed and gifted me a copy of his grandmother’s latest biography, I also realised what a mammoth task he had been entrusted with — to preserve her legacy, and how he had upheld that trust: a proud grandson of the Queen of Crime.It was when I mentioned how strange it was that Christie had never visited India, that he glanced at me with a twinkle in his blue eyes, and said, “Oh, but she did!” I was startled. This was contrary to all that we believed. A few minutes later, as I skimmed through the numerous black-and-white, well-preserved photos, I found some that made my heart race — pictures of Christie with a garland, descending from an Indian Airlines plane. Here, finally, was the missing link to a long-standing puzzle.I was on the threshold of solving a real mystery, but I needed to know more. At my request, the archivist Joseph Keogh dug deeper and came up with some fascinating, unpublicised facts. Christie had indeed visited India — not once, but twice. From her passport stamps, he traced her travel itinerary for the two trips.Her first trip was in Jan 1960, when she visited Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), then India and Pakistan. From Jan 11 to Feb 2, she travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai), headed to South India’s Madras (now Chennai), did some sightseeing at the Ajanta Caves, and then on to Delhi. Between Feb 2 and 9, she went to Nepal and returned to Patna and Delhi, finally leaving for Karachi on Feb 17.Some letters were also found that referenced her trips. It appeared that the 1960 trip was for a lecture tour by her second husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan.Future plans are, roughly, leave for Madras today — go via southern India to Bombay arriving 17th or 18th — Then some sightseeing near Bombay Agenta Caves (sic) etc and on to Delhi and then to Nepal on Jan 31st for a week — c/o British Embassy would find us there as I’m not sure what the hotel is.Our plans are a bit different at the moment as accommodation at hotels is very hard to get exactly when one wants it but we shall be in and out of the Ashoka Hotel at Delhi between Jan 28th and Feb 2nd — and then Nepal (c/o British Embassy Kathmandu) 2nd to 9th then in and out of Ashoka again finally leaving it on Feb 17th for Karachi. So forward anything you think I ought to see to the Ashoka at Delhi — but nothing that I needn’t!!On our arrival here yesterday evening, several archaeologists were waiting with two porters and loads of archaeological material from their… dig. The examination of same intrigued the Ashoka guests very much.Christie’s second trip to India, a year later, seemed to be for leisure. The passport has a Palam, New Delhi stamp (month not specified) in 1961. This time she visited Srinagar in Kashmir and stayed at the Oberoi Palace. This is what she wrote to her daughter Rosalind:Lake and mountains rather lovely. This is a Hotel rather like at Jaipur — converted Rajah’s Palace — miles and miles of corridors — enormous rooms and we are in a kind of supersuite looking over lake. It’s all terribly dried up by this time of year — one ought really to come in May-June. Now one must be content by rich beds of red salvia and dahlias in the Hotel garden. Temp is about 50 at night. Delicious hot sun to sit in and about 60 in day. Suits me very well. We made some excursions — to the various Mogul gardens — and to a lake… which is very beautiful and ringed with snowclad mountains. You can see the mountains now after the rain. We have to leave here and go to the Hotel in the town — but expect that our booking for Nov 2nd to Delhi will be all right.Here we are in the Ashoka. I’m glad we had a good ten days and in a perfect Hotel for old ladies (very few of them nowadays) where I could sit, in the sun — and look at a view like a Japanese print. Lovely! The letters revealed Christie’s bright, chirpy personality and tongue-in-cheek humour, her eagerness to explore India and her appreciation of scenic beauty. She seemed happy to be in India.But I pondered why her trips were not well-known. Was it because photographs were a rarity then or because she checked into the hotels in her husband’s name — or perhaps simply because Agatha Christie was a private person?Whatever the reason, I was thrilled with my discovery. That sunny day with Mathew, Lucy and Gwynnie the dog carried an extra fulfilling zing because of this exciting revelation.I had always sensed a deep connection to Agatha Christie. But being the chosen one to unravel the mystery of her India trips felt truly special.The author is an award-winning writer of mystery novels[Extracts and photographs used with permission from Mathew Prichard and The Christie Archive Trust.

Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party.

Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side.

The Congress has continued its tradition of insulting the Maratha warrior king since the time of Nehru who made comments against Shivaji Maharaj in his book Discovery of India.""

Envoy Drops Bombshell | Watch

NEW DELHI: Chinese Embassy officials of interfering directly in the local affairs of South Asian countries, particularly in Nepal, former Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay claimed, and also warned India to be vigilant about its dealings with Beijing.In an conversation at ANI podcast, Sangay voiced concern over China’s “expansionist” policies and its efforts to “checkmate” India’s influence in the region.Asked whether India, like some Southeast Asian nations, avoids the Tibet issue to preserve ties with Beijing, Sangay replied that he did not believe India followed that approach, but stressed that “China is systematically working” to curb New Delhi’s reach.""India has a bigger stake with China,"" Sangay said. ""Just look at not just Tibet, not just the border area. Look at all the neighbouring countries. In Southeast Asia or Central Asia, wherever India wants to have its influence or relationship, China is always there to checkmate.""Using Nepal as an example, he alleged that Chinese officials had become “the most powerful” players in Kathmandu, “perhaps more powerful than the Indian or American embassies.”He said similar patterns of interference were visible in Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. “They come and interfere and influence. I don’t want to say they control you, but they come inside your own house,” he said.""And the larger point that you raised about, you know, in Asia, how many people will take up the issue of Tibet because they don't want to have conflict with China, which is a fact on the one hand. On the other hand, what we say is that what happened to Tibet will happen to you. So if you don't understand and study Tibet, it will happen to you,"" he added.He pointed to Nepal as a clear example of Chinese political overreach. ""Let's say Nepal -- they didn't believe so, right? Now, yes, the Chinese embassy and the officials are interfering in local issues,"" he said. ""The Chinese Embassy, perhaps, some of my friends say, is the most powerful in Kathmandu -- more powerful than the Indian Embassy or American Embassy. Some say that.""He highlighted China's full physical control over Tibet and its current approach in other countries. ""The difference is the physical control of Tibet,"" Sangay said. ""Other than that, political influence of the Chinese government -- and through the embassies -- in all these neighbouring countries and all these Asian countries is a fact.""He also framed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visits to Tibet as strategic signals aimed at India, noting the region’s shared border and China’s large military deployment there. While transcripts of Xi’s latest speech to troops were not released—coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Beijing—Sangay said he was “sure” it echoed previous calls to “prepare for war or incursion” against India.Reflecting on his own experience, Sangay described how Tibetans had found a temporary home in India after fleeing their homeland. “As a Buddhist, we believe in impermanence. Once you lose your country, you’re nomadic,” he said, adding that India became “our home” after Tibetans fled. Although he now lives in the United States, he said he feels an enduring cultural bond with India: “As soon as I come out of Indira Gandhi Airport, when you smell the Delhi air… for your mind, it’s just calming. ”He stressed that ties between Tibetans and Indians remain strong. “Whenever I meet Indians, I immediately say Namaskar… immediately, you become friends.”Sangay also recalled how, during his tenure from 2011 to 2021, Chinese pressure often accompanied periods of India–China rapprochement. He cited the 2018 “Thank You India” event planned by the Tibetan administration, which was scaled back after India reportedly advised officials to avoid participation in the midst of efforts to ease tensions with Beijing.Despite such episodes, Sangay emphasised India’s consistent support. ""No matter which party or which person becomes Prime Minister, India has always treated Tibetans well. We cannot think of any better host for Tibetans,"" he said, adding that the preservation of Tibetan identity, education, and religious institutions has been possible due to India's support.","Former Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay spoke to ANI podcast.

"Monsoon starts an early withdrawal from Rajasthan, marking its retreat from the country",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monsoon-starts-an-early-withdrawal-from-rajasthan/articleshow/123889382.cms,"NEW DELHI: The southwest (summer) monsoon started withdrawing from some parts of west Rajasthan on Sunday against the normal date of Sept 17, the IMD said. It marked the beginning of this year’s monsoon retreat from the country. Normally, the withdrawal process ends on Oct 15 - a few days ahead of the onset of winter monsoon in Peninsular India.It’s the earliest withdrawal of monsoon since 2015, when the retreat began on Sept 4, under the old regime where the normal date of beginning of the withdrawal used to be Sept 1 based on records during 1901-1940.It's also the earliest withdrawal since 2020 under the new regime when the normal date was revised as Sept 17 based on data during 1971-2019. Under the new regime, monsoon onset over Kerala remains the same (June 1). There is also no change in the final withdrawal date over south India (Oct 15). The normal withdrawal date for Delhi is Sept 25.Announcing the beginning of the retreat of summer monsoon on Sunday, the IMD also predicted that the conditions are favourable for its withdrawal from some more parts of Rajasthan and some parts of Punjab and Gujarat during the next 2-3 days.Meanwhile, heavy to very heavy rainfall is predicted by the Met department over northeastern states and Maharashtra for the next three days.Normally, monsoon covers the entire India in 38 days (June 1-July 8). This year, it covered the entire country in 37 days after making an early onset on May 24 and covering the whole India by June 29.Though early onset/withdrawal or coverage has nothing to do with the overall status of the monsoon, it certainly guides farming activities, and water and hydro-power management during the rainy season.Early onset of monsoon helped farmers begin early sowing of kharif (summer sown) crops this year. The early withdrawal by just three days will, however, not impact the acreage as the sowing operation has already completed in most parts of the country. Even all key reservoirs have enough water to sustain the Rabi (winter sown) crops during Oct-March cycle.IMD has predicted an 'above normal' monsoon this year and it's already reflected in over 7% more than normal cumulative (June 1 - Sept 14) rainfall in the country so far with northwest India recording nearly 32% more than normal rainfall during the period, leading to multiple disasters including flooding and crop damage in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir.Except east & northeast India that faced a cumulative rainfall deficit of nearly 20%, the rest of the country received surplus rainfall with the central India getting 10.5% more than normal rainfall and south peninsular India getting 7.5% more than normal rainfall during the monsoon season.Good rainfall this year in most parts of the country helped increase the total acreage (1105 lakh hectares) which is more than last year (1078 lakh hectares) and also more than the normal acreage (1096 lakh hectares) for Kharif crops.","The southwest (summer) monsoon started withdrawing from some parts of west Rajasthan on Sunday against the normal date of Sept 17.

For them, kickboxing is more than jab-cross drills and roundhouse kicks; it is a battle against financial struggles and a path towards sporting glory.Together, these teenagers have stacked up an impressive medal tally - multiple state golds, national silvers, bronzes, and even international podium finishes. ""Their haul includes international medals across prestigious events such as Turkey Kickboxing World Cup (2023), Uzbekistan Kickboxing World Cup (2024) and Open International Championship in Delhi (2025),"" said C Suresh Babu, chief coach of the Indian kickboxing team.Among the youngsters is M Dharshan (14), a Class 9 student of Don Bosco, Villivakkam. His father, J Murali, is a fish seller at Kolathur, and his mother, M Kamatchi, a homemaker. Known for sharp front kicks that unsettle opponents, the boy has already won a bronze at the 2025 International Championship in Delhi, along with other state and national medals. ""I have been training in kickboxing for four years.

Amnesty scheme aims to improve compliance

NEW DELHI: In a move that could bring relief to lakhs of vehicle owners, the Delhi govt is likely to launch a one-time amnesty scheme, offering 50-70% waiver on outstanding traffic challans. Expected to roll out in the coming months, the scheme aims to reduce the massive backlog of unpaid challans and ease the burden on the judicial system.Officials indicated violators may be given a 2-3-month window to pay the reduced fines.A transport department official said the proposal was discussed at a high-level meeting. ""This will be a one-time relaxation for two-, three-, and four-wheeler owners. People should treat it as an opportunity to clear dues because stricter penalties, such as registration cancellation, could follow,"" the official said.The idea is to clear long-pending challans without the fear of hefty penalties, reduce court caseloads, and improve compliance,"" another senior official said.The scheme will apply to both traffic and transport challans. While the transport department issues challans for violations like expired pollution clearance certificates (PUCC), wrong-side driving, and overloading, traffic police handle offences including helmetless riding, red-light jumping, and speeding.Only non-serious violations will be covered un-der the amnesty. Drunk driving, unauthorised driving, and driving without a valid licence, and other serious offences will not be covered in the scheme.E-challans are considered a better mechanism to deal with violators because they are presented with photographic proof captured by cameras. Traffic policemen or transport department enforcement teams often use an app to record violations, which they capture on their phone. A text notice informs the violator on his registered phone about the infraction and the fine can be paid online on the website.Still, many violators delay payments, waiting for Lok Adalat sessions where fines are often reduced. The absence of interest or penalties on delayed payments also discourages timely compliance. Infrastructure issues - faulty signals, poor signage, and confusing road layouts - further contribute to disputes and non-payment.Currently, minor (compoundable) challans can be settled on the spot, while serious (non-compoundable) ones go through virtual or district courts, adding to the legal backlog. ""If this scheme doesn't see proper response, the department may take stricter measures like cancelling registrations,"" an official warned.""Under Union road transport ministry rules, the transport department has even the authority to disallow those with multiple pending challans from accessing online transactions related to their vehicles by putting it in 'not to be transacted' category on the Vahan portal,"" the official said.","The scheme aims to reduce the massive backlog of unpaid challans and ease the burden on the judicial system. Officials indicated violators may be given a 2-3-month window to pay the reduced fines.

Shedeur Sanders avoids straight answer on Ravens draft rumors following Browns’ embarrassing loss to division rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-avoids-straight-answer-on-ravens-draft-rumors-following-browns-embarrassing-loss-to-division-rivals/articleshow/123889623.cms,"Shedeur Sanders avoids addressing Ravens draft rumors (Getty Images)

Shedeur Sanders draft decision raises eyebrows



Did Sanders make the right call with the Browns?



When Week 2 of the NFL season kicked off, the drama was already in full swing. ESPN’s Adam Schefter dropped a bombshell: the Baltimore Ravens had planned to draft Shedeur Sanders in the fifth round of April’s draft before the young quarterback made it clear he wanted no part of Baltimore. Hours later, Sanders and his Cleveland Browns were handed a lopsided 41-17 loss to those very Ravens, sparking fresh questions about what might have been.According to Schefter, the Ravens were ready to use the 141st overall pick on Sanders. But the Colorado star reportedly told the team he didn’t want to sit behind Lamar Jackson, a two-time MVP with one of the most secure jobs in football. “Before the Ravens could turn in the card, the former Colorado star let it be known to Baltimore that he didn't want to be on a roster with Lamar Jackson,” Schefter reported.That bold move paved Sanders’ path to Cleveland, who traded up three spots later to grab him. Yet when asked about the reports after Sunday’s defeat, Sanders chose not to dig into the past. “My response is I’m focused on the now,” Sanders said via Cleveland.com. “I don’t really talk about anything in the past and whatever happened in the past, it is what it is. I’m more focused on now and I’m more focused on this game we just had and figuring out how to move forward from that.Pressed further, Sanders leaned on humor and deflection: “You wouldn’t believe my memory don’t even go back that far. I don’t remember anything post-draft. I remember I’m here, I go to practice every day and there’s a 24-hour rule.”The Browns may not be the powerhouse the Ravens are, but Sanders’ road to playing time is much clearer in Cleveland. Veteran Joe Flacco is 40, and rookie Dillon Gabriel already leapfrogged Sanders for the backup role after a sharp preseason showing. If Flacco falters or the Browns stumble out of playoff contention, the door could open for Sanders sooner rather than later.Still, some argue Baltimore would have offered more stability and long-term growth under John Harbaugh. For now, Sanders must prove he made the right call. If his talent shines, the Browns could finally stabilize their long-shaky quarterback future. If not, Cleveland risks reliving a familiar cycle.Also Read: Eagles escape with narrow 20-17 win over Chiefs after Travis Kelce’s late blunder costs Kansas City dearly","Shedeur Sanders was set to be drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the fifth round of the NFL draft.

Michael Penix Jr. earns starting nod after late-season surge

Kirk Cousins remains a high-paid backup with experience on standby



The Atlanta Falcons are facing the Minnesota Vikings in Week 2 of the 2025 NFL season, but all eyes won’t be on Kirk Cousins. Instead, the spotlight belongs to rookie Michael Penix Jr. , who has been named the Falcons’ starting quarterback over the veteran signal-caller. This shift marks a new chapter for Atlanta as they embrace younger talent in a key position.Despite his high-profile four-year, $180 million contract, Cousins found himself relegated to backup duty following a rough end to the 2024 season. Over a five-game stretch, Cousins completed just 62.7% of his passes, threw one touchdown against nine interceptions, and saw the Falcons go 1-4.Falcons coach Raheem Morris explained the move, saying, ""After review we have made the decision Michael Penix will be the Atlanta Falcons starting quarterback moving forward. This was a football decision and we are fully focused on preparing the team for Sunday's game against the New York Giants.""Penix, in limited action, showed promise with 775 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions over three games.The Falcons evidently felt that the rookie’s performance and potential warranted the starting role, a decision that has reshaped the team’s quarterback dynamics for the season.While Cousins no longer starts, his presence on the roster remains significant. The 37-year-old veteran brings experience and leadership to the sidelines, ready to step in if needed. During his first year with the Falcons, he finished 14 starts with a 7-7 record, 3,508 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. Though his passer rating of 88.6 was below the league average, his knowledge and ability to mentor a young quarterback like Penix remain valuable assets.Also Read: Which NFL teams observed a moment of silence for Charlie Kirk amid nationwide mourning in Week 2?

NEW DELHI: A powerful thunderstorm accompanied by heavy rain lashed Delhi overnight and caused widespread disruption across the city, including delayed flights, waterlogged roads, uprooted trees, and electricity poles. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that the storm brought wind speeds of up to 82 kmph and 81.2 mm of rainfall within just six hours, from 11.30 pm to 5.30 am.The downpour severely impacted flight operations at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport. According to airport sources, 49 flights were diverted between 11.30 pm and 4 am due to adverse weather conditions.IndiGo, in a post on X at 3.59 am, confirmed ""temporary disruptions in flight operations"" and noted that airside congestion was easing. By 5.54 am, the airline said that flight operations had resumed with clearer skies over the capital. However, according to Flightradar24.com, several flights remained delayed or cancelled, with average departure delays of over 30 minutes.Meanwhile, multiple key roads including Moti Bagh, Minto Road, Delhi Cantonment, and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg, were partially submerged due to heavy waterlogging. Visuals from Delhi Cantt showed a bus and a vehicle submerged in a flooded underpass.Other affected areas included ITO, Dhaula Kuan, Subroto Park, Nanakpura Underpass, and Chanakyapuri, where severe waterlogging led to massive traffic congestion.The IMD had earlier issued a red alert for Delhi and adjoining areas on Saturday, warning of thunderstorms, heavy rain, and strong winds for the next few hours.",Storm brought wind speeds of up to 82 kmph and 81.2 mm of rainfall within just six hours. 49 flights diverted between 11.30 pm and 4 am due to adverse weather conditions.

"Astronaut, IISc prof pitch for back-up control for safer re-entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/astronaut-iisc-prof-pitch-for-back-up-control-for-safer-re-entry/articleshow/121388989.cms,"BENGALURU: Isro astronaut Group Captain Angad Pratap and Assistant Professor Jishnu Keshavan from IISc, are in the final phases of their research to demonstrate the viability of a manual control system as an additional safety measure during the critical atmospheric re-entry phase of a manned spacecraft returning to Earth.The re-entry phase involves complex aerodynamics and narrow margins for error. Too steep an entry could lead to excessive heating, while too shallow a path risks the capsule skipping off the atmosphere. Pratap and Keshavan’s research focuses on a possible scenario of a failure in the primary automatic Navigation, Guidance and Control (NGC) system of a crew module during re-entry.To address this, the team explored whether an astronaut could manually guide the spacecraft in such conditions with support from a partially degraded NGC system. Their system is not being designed to replace the primary NGC architecture but to complement it.The objective of automated guidance during re-entry is to ensure accurate tracking of a predefined reference trajectory all the way to touchdown. This requires designing a guidance law capable of countering potential disturbances that could otherwise alter the spacecraft’s descent profile and cause deviations from the intended landing point—an outcome that must be avoided in practice.As per the abstract of their research presented at the recently concluded Global Space Exploration Conference (GLEX-2025), to mitigate this possibility, the study explored the feasibility of incorporating “a novel bank-angle based manual control scheme in a manned spacecraft during re-entry in the atmospheric altitudes of 120km - 10 km”.“Bank-angle manipulation” used here is the same fundamental principle employed by automated systems, but adapted for human operation, as per the abstract titled “Robust Manual Guidance Law For Manned Spacecraft Re-Entry Applications”.Using sophisticated 6-DOF (six degree-of-freedom) modelling incorporating both translational and rotational dynamics, researchers demonstrated that human pilots could successfully guide a representative manned spacecraft from re-entry altitude to parachute deployment while maintaining all critical parameters within safe limits.Manual mode is proposed as an additional backup to the multiple chains of automated modes of reentry control in case of the flight profile either exceeding predefined perturbation models, or identical failure across all automated control chains.Incorporating this additional degree of manual redundancy may enhance mission reliability for the crew capsule. The manual control scheme was explored from the standpoint of guiding the manned spacecraft manually from a predefined reentry altitude to the terminal altitude thus guaranteeing subsequent touchdown at the predefined target location.The study describes the design and testing of a “reduced-order” flight display and manual control setup intended for emergency use. Drawing from operational precedents such as Nasa’s Apollo missions, the system provides a pilot with essential information through an intuitive interface. This would allow the crew to steer the capsule towards a pre-designated landing area, even in the absence of automated controls.","Isro astronaut Angad Pratap and Assistant Professor Jishnu Keshavan from IISc, are in the final phases of their research to demonstrate the viability of a manual control system.

A precise response, not a war cry



The Pahalgam attack and its intent



A united Indian voice to the world



NEW DELHI: In a strong and clear message to global community, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday explained how India gave a firm but measured response after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack . Speaking at Indian Consulate in New York, Tharoor said India chose to ""hit hard and hit smart"", targeting only specific terrorist camps in Pakistan, without escalating the situation into a larger conflict.India launched its counterterror strikes on May 7 in Pakistan and PoK under Operation Sindoor , as a strong response to Pahalgam massacre.Tharoor is leading an all-party delegation visiting several countries in Americas to highlight India’s united stand against terrorism. Their first stop in New York was the 9/11 Memorial.Tharoor said it was an emotional moment, especially in light of the recent attack in Pahalgam.“It was obviously a very moving moment for us,” he said, “but it was also meant to send a strong message. We are here in a city which is bearing still the scars of that savage terrorist attack in the wake of yet another terrorist attack in our own country.”He added that the visit is about standing in solidarity and reminding the world that terrorism is a global threat that must be faced together.“We came both as a reminder that this is a shared problem, but also out of a spirit of solidarity with the victims... It’s a global problem, it’s a scourge and we must all fight it unitedly.”Though he is part of the Opposition, Tharoor supported the central government’s swift action after the Pahalgam attack.“I don’t work for the government, as you know. I work for an opposition party, but I myself authored an op-ed in one of India’s leading papers, within a couple of days saying that the time had come to hit hard and hit smart and I’m pleased to say that’s exactly what India did.”He explained that India struck nine known terror bases, including Lashkar-e-Taiba ’s base in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammad’s headquarters in Bahawalpur. These groups have long been linked to attacks on India and other countries.“India sent a clear message that it was not going to take terror lying down... by delivering very precisely, calculated, calibrated strikes... this was not meant to be the opening salvo in a protracted war but just an act of retribution.”Tharoor described the Pahalgam attack as a brutal and deliberate attempt to create communal tension in India.“It was a bunch of people going around identifying the religions of the people before them and killing them on that basis, which was clearly intended to provoke a backlash in the rest of India, since the victims were overwhelmingly Hindu.”But he praised the people of Jammu and Kashmir, from political leaders to ordinary citizens, for standing together in unity.“There was an extraordinary amount of togetherness cutting across religious and other divides that people have tried to provoke. The message is very clear that there was a malign intent... India, sadly, had no reason to doubt where it came from.”Tharoor also mentioned that a terror group called The Resistance Front (TRF), known to be linked to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, quickly claimed responsibility for the killings. Despite India presenting evidence to the United Nations in previous years, the group was still not officially condemned in recent UN statements - largely due to opposition from Pakistan and China.He said, "" Within one hour of the atrocity, a group called the Resistance Front had claimed credit. The Resistance Front was known for some years to be a frontal organisation of the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is on the US-designated terror list as well as UN sanctions committees. India had gone to the UN sanctions committee with information about the Resistance Front in 2023 and 2024, and now sadly, it acted in 2025. ..Pakistan chose to follow its usual path of denial.""""Sadly Pakistan chose to follow its usual path of denial, in fact, Pakistan with the help of China succeeded in removing the reference to TRF from the press statement drafted in the Security Council of the UN two days later.”The all-party delegation includes MPs from different political backgrounds -- BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena, TDP, JMM, and LJP - along with former Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu. Their mission is to meet government officials, lawmakers, think tanks, media, and the public across countries.“Our idea is very much to speak to a cross section of public and political opinion... to enlarge your understanding of our thinking and our concern about what’s going on.”“We will be in every country, meeting members of the executive, meeting members of the legislature, meeting big tankers and influential foreign policy experts, and at the same time interacting with the media and public opinion.”In his interaction at the Consulate, Thiruvananthapuram MP said and referred to PM Modi's ""new normal"" resolve, ""We are determined now that there's got to be a new bottom line to this. We have tried everything, international dossier, complaints...everything has been tried. Pakistan has remained in denial, there has been absolutely no conviction, no serious criminal prosecution, no attempt to dismantle the terror infrastructure in that country, and the persistence of safe havens. ..you (Pakistan) do this, you are going to get this back and we have demonstrated with this Operation (Operation Sindoor) that we can do it with a degree of precision.""",India launched its counterterror strikes on May 7 in Pakistan and PoK under Operation Sindoor.

We want Pakistan to dismantle this terrorist infrastructure and take action against terrorists,"" Azad said.Echoing the sentiment, BJP MP Phangnon Konyak underlined Pakistan's continued involvement in terror activities since the partition and urged Bahrain ask Pakistan to take responsibility. ""Since partition, Pakistan has not stopped its terror activities against India. Our request is if Bahrain can also come forward and ask Pakistan to take responsibility for its actions,"" she said, asserting that India's stand against terrorism is ""very clear"" and that any future attack will be met with a firm response.The delegation includes BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey, Phangnon Konyak, Rekha Sharma, as well as Satnam Singh Sandhu, AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Ambassador Harsh Shringla.",All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( AIMIM ) MP Asaduddin Owaisi strongly condemned the misuse of religion by terrorist groups to justify violence.

One Month Since Pahalgam Attack: How India Punished, Isolated Pakistan Since April 22 | Op Sindoor

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor outlined India’s firm but measured response to the Pahalgam terror attack on Saturday in New York. The MP is leading a multi-party delegation to five countries as part of India's global outreach against terrorism amid Operation Sindoor.While speaking at the Indian Consulate in New York, Tharoor said the attack was carried out by militants who identified victims by their religion before killing them, in what he called a clear attempt to provoke communal violence.“It was a bunch of people going around identifying the religions of the people before them and killing them on that basis, which was clearly intended to provoke a backlash in the rest of India, since the victims were overwhelmingly Hindu,” Tharoor said, adding, ""There was an extraordinary amount of togetherness cutting across religious and other divides in India that people have tried to provoke. The message is very clear that there was a malign intent. .. India, sadly, had no reason to doubt where it came from.""Tharoor emphasised that within an hour, the Resistance Front claimed responsibility. He reminded the audience that this group is linked to the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba and had already been flagged to the UN in 2023 and 2024. “Sadly, Pakistan chose to follow its usual path of denial,” he said, noting that China supported the removal of the Resistance Front’s mention from the UN Security Council’s press statement.Describing India's response, Tharoor said, “The time had come to hit hard and hit smart and I’m pleased to say that’s exactly what India did.” He said strikes were carried out on nine known terror sites, including those linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur. “India sent a clear message that it was not going to take terror lying down,” he added.Tharoor stressed that the strikes were precise and limited in scope. “It was not meant to be the opening salvo in a protracted war but just an act of retribution,” he explained.Tharoor made it clear that while India responded firmly to terrorism, it does not seek escalation or armed conflict. He said India’s priorities lie elsewhere, focused on growth and development.“We are not interested in warfare with Pakistan. We would much rather be left alone to grow our economy and pull our people into the world they are getting ready for in the 21st century. But, the Pakistanis sadly, we might be a status quo power but they are not...they covet territory India controls, and they want to have it at any price. If they can't get it through conventional means, they are willing to get it through terrorism, and that is not acceptable. ..”Tharoor said the all-party delegation’s first stop was the 9/11 Memorial in New York, symbolising their solidarity with victims of terrorism worldwide.We came both as a reminder that this is a shared problem, but also out of a spirit of solidarity with the victims...

Several parts of neighbouring Haryana, including Jhajjar, also witnessed heavy downpour.The IMD had on Saturday warned of a thunderstorm cell approaching Delhi and adjoining areas from the west and northwest. “Under its influence, severe thunderstorm or dust-raising wind activity accompanied by frequent lightning and gusty winds (speed reaching 40–60 km/h or more) will likely affect parts of the city in the next 1 to 2 hours,” the IMD said in a statement.The warning was part of the agency’s Nowcast alert system, based on immediate weather patterns. Authorities urged people to remain indoors and avoid open areas. “Avoid open spaces and not to take shelter under trees,” the IMD cautioned, also advising people to stay clear of weak walls, unstable structures, and water bodies.The weather event raised concerns over possible impacts, including uprooting of trees, falling branches, and moderate damage to crops like bananas and papayas.Dry limbs could snap and fall due to strong winds, and localised dust storms were also likely, the IMD said.Officials asked residents to remain alert and follow safety instructions as the weather remains volatile across the region.Severe waterlogging was reported in several parts of Delhi after heavy rains and thunderstorm struck the national capital in the early hours of Sunday. Areas affected include Moti Bagh, Minto Road, and near Delhi Airport Terminal 1.Visuals from Delhi's Minto Road show a car submerged due to severe waterlogging caused by the heavy rainfall. The heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms also lashed several parts of Haryana's Jhajjar.This was the second major storm event in less than a week. On Wednesday, strong winds and a dust storm swept through Delhi, with wind speeds reaching 50–60 km/h, and gusts touching 70 km/h. Light rainfall was also reported, along with thunderstorms in parts of Haryana's Karnal district.The mid-week storm had caused widespread power outages across the capital. Neighbourhoods such as Bawana, Narela, Jahangirpuri, Civil Lines, Shakti Nagar, Model Town, Wazirabad, Dhirpur, and Burari faced disruptions in electricity supply. According to Tata Power DDL, power was deliberately suspended in some areas to prevent electrocution, as trees and branches fell on live wires, damaging infrastructure.","Severe waterlogging was reported in several parts of Delhi after heavy rains and thunderstorm struck the national capital in the early hours of Sunday.

Conditions favourable for advance of SW monsoon

.

NEW DELHI: The southwest (summer) monsoon hit Kerala on Saturday, eight days ahead of its normal onset date of June 1, marking the beginning of the four-month-long rainy season in India. This is the earliest date of monsoon onset over Kerala after 2009 when it set in over the state on May 23, said India Meteorological Department (IMD).Besides showers in Kerala and other parts of south peninsula, including Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka, the monsoon on Saturday simultaneously arrived in Mizoram (NE) - 12 days before the normal onset date of June 5.Though the monsoon's arrival simultaneously over Kerala and NE is quite an uncommon phenomenon, this time it has happened second year in a row. Before 2024, simultaneous onset happened on May 30, 2017.Normally southwest monsoon sets in over Kerala on June 1 and it advances over most part of northeast India by June 5. Advance of the monsoon to most parts of Tamil Nadu and some parts of Karnataka on the very first day of the onset is significant but not unusual. It, however, signals the possibility of its fast progress in the next few days.""Monsoon arrival in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is not unusual. It invariably happens and the monsoon will now make further progress as per our forecast,"" IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI. Announcing the monsoon onset, the Met department said the conditions are favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into entire Goa, some parts of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, some more parts of Karnataka, remaining parts of Tamil Nadu, some more parts of northeastern states, and some parts of sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim during the next 2-3 days.Early monsoon onset and its further advance will pave the way for early start of the kharif (summer crops) sowing operations in the country, specifically in south and central India. Since the IMD predicted 'above normal' monsoon rainfall in most parts of the country this year, the situation may help increase the acreage and production of the summer crops such as paddy, pulses, maize and other coarse cereals and steer the country towards realising its goal of record foodgrains output of 354 million tonne in the 2025-26 crop year.On Saturday, the monsoon advanced into the entire Lakshadweep area, Kerala, Mahe, some parts of Karnataka, remaining parts of Maldives and Comorin area, many parts of Tamil Nadu and some parts of Mizoram. IMD, meanwhile, predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall over west coast (Kerala, Karnataka, coastal Maharashtra & Goa) during the next seven days; coastal and ghat areas of Karnataka till May 27; and ghat areas of Tamil Nadu on May 25-26 due to prevailing weather phenomena.","The southwest (summer) monsoon hit Kerala on Saturday, eight days ahead of its normal onset date of June 1.

His absence has fueled political speculation, especially with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to Bihar ahead of the assembly elections due this year.The high-level meeting, chaired by PM Modi at Bharat Mandapam, focused on the theme ‘Viksit Rajya for Viksit Bharat@2047’ and brought together chief ministers, lieutenant governors, and Union ministers to chart out development strategies.However, Nitish Kumar’s absence stood out, especially since he heads a government aligned with the BJP.Among the states that skipped the meeting were Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal, Bihar, and Puducherry, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam said, according to PTI.Nitish Kumar's decision to skip the high-level meeting has sparked political speculation, with Congress and RJD leaders calling it ""unfortunate"" and suggesting it may carry a deeper political message.Senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar called the move ""significant,"" noting that ""his decision to skip it sends a major political message,"" especially when the meeting was chaired by the Prime Minister himself, according to IANS.RJD leader Manoj Jha said that Kumar's absence from the meeting suggests that ""others are deciding his priorities these days.""Speaking to PTI, Jha said, ""The NITI Aayog meeting is happening at a critical juncture. We heard that Bihar CM is not attending, his priorities are set by other people these days. The GDP size is a myth if it is not reflected in every home, the development would be hollow.""""We also hope for 'nafrat-mukt' (hatred-free) Bharat... The situation is Bihar is like there is no pilot, and auto-pilot has gone defunct,"" Jha further added.There has been no official explanation for Nitish Kumar's absence, and the exact reason for his missing the meeting remains unclear.This isn’t the first time Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has skipped a Niti Aayog meeting. He was absent from the 2023 Governing Council meeting as well. In 2024, he again chose not to attend, with Bihar being represented instead by deputy chief ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha.The council is the apex body of the Niti Ayog, which includes chief ministers, lieutenant governors of all states and Union territories along with several Union ministers. This was the first major meeting of the PM with chief ministers of all states and lieutenant governors after US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs and Operation Sindoor.Despite the absence of some states, the meeting went ahead with participation from several state heads.PM Modi began the Niti Aayog meeting by advocating for joint development initiatives between the Centre and states. He stressed the importance of developing cities that are prepared for the future, considering India's growing urbanisation.“India is getting rapidly urbanised. We should work towards future-ready cities. Growth, innovation, and sustainability should be the engines of urban development,” the Prime Minister said.Highlighting the theme of “Team India,” PM Modi added, “We have to increase the speed of development. If the Centre and all States come together and work as a team, no goal is impossible.”The Prime Minister encouraged states to enhance tourism, recommending that each state should establish one internationally recognised tourist destination.“One State: One Global Destination should be our mantra. It will not only elevate that location but also lead to the development of surrounding areas,” he added.The Niti Aayog governing council meeting is a platform for the Centre and states/UTs to discuss how to work together to achieve the goal of a developed India by 2047. It focuses on building consensus on how each state can contribute to the country’s overall progress.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar was among several opposition-ruled state leaders who skipped the 10th Niti Aayog governing council meeting.

Most of these cases are mild and under home care.”This comes a day after the Delhi government issued a Covid advisory, asking hospitals to ensure the availability of beds, oxygen, medicines, and vaccines. Health institutions have also been directed to send all positive samples for genome sequencing to Lok Nayak Hospital.Although the World Health Organization declared the pandemic over in May 2023, Covid continues to circulate globally. In India, the majority of cases remain mild, with no deaths or ICU admissions linked to the latest rise in infections.Health experts have advised the public—particularly the elderly, pregnant women, and those with underlying health conditions—to resume basic precautions such as wearing masks in enclosed spaces and frequent handwashing.Doctors also recommend influenza vaccination to reduce the risk and severity of co-infections.

"'Tough life': SC directs IAF not to release woman officer who served in Operations Sindoor, Balakot till further orders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tough-life-sc-directs-iaf-not-to-release-woman-officer-who-served-in-operations-sindoor-balakot-till-further-orders/articleshow/121362528.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court directed the government and the Indian Air Force (IAF) not to release Wing Commander Nikita Pandey from service, after she alleged discrimination in being denied permanent commission despite her critical role in Operation Balakot and Operation Sindoor. Noting a ""tough life"" for Short Service Commission (SSC) officers, the bench in ""layman's suggestion"" said its ""uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces.""A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh issued notice to the Centre and the IAF on Thursday, seeking their response on Pandey’s plea, news agency PTI reported. She claimed that although she ranked second in the country among expert fighter controllers and had served over 13.5 years, she was being discharged due to a 2019 policy change that denied her a permanent commission.“Our Air Force is one of the best organisations in the world. Officers are very commendable. The quality of coordination they have exhibited - I think it's unparalleled. Therefore, we always salute them. They are a big asset for the nation. They are the nation, in a way. Because of them, we are able to sleep at night,” Justice Kant said.The bench expressed concern over the uncertainty faced by SSC officers, stating that a long tenure without permanent commission needed to be addressed.“That sense of uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces. It's a layman's suggestion, because we are not experts. On minimum benchmarks, there can't be a compromise,” Justice Kant added.Representing Pandey, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy argued that her client was an expert fighter controller, who had played a key role in the Integrated Air Command and Control Systems (IACCS) deployed during Operations Sindoor and Balakot.Pandey’s case, Guruswamy said, was affected by policy shifts that gave her just a month’s notice to end her career despite her stellar service record.Appearing for the government and the IAF, additional solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati said that the officer had been found unfit by the selection board and had approached the apex court directly without first filing a representation. She also confirmed that a second selection board would now review Pandey’s case.Bhati, herself from a military background, acknowledged the difficult position of SSC officers but explained, “There are a limited number of posts. It's a very steep pyramid structure.”She noted that typically, 90–95 per cent of officers considered for permanent commission are found fit, but only a few miss out due to comparative merit.Justice Kant responded, urging a more accommodating approach, “You can have a policy of taking that many SCC officers who can be accommodated in the Permanent Commission, if they are found suitable. If you have 100 SCC officers, you should have the capacity to take 100 of them to the permanent commission.”He also emphasised that women officers have performed exceedingly well and highlighted the need for systemic capacity to retain them.The court directed that Wing Commander Pandey must not be released from service until further orders and posted the matter for hearing on August 6.However, the bench clarified that no equity would be created in the officer’s favour at this stage and that all contentions remain open.","Wing Commander Nikita Pandey alleged discrimination in being denied permanent commission despite her critical role in Operation Balakot and Operation Sindoor.

NEW DELHI: The Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) on Saturday arrested a contractual health worker posted in the border district of Kutch for allegedly sharing sensitive information about military establishments with a Pakistani spy.According to an ATS release, the accused, Sahdevsinh Gohil, 28, was lured by a Pakistani agent who identified herself as Aditi Bharadwaj.He allegedly shared information about both under-construction and existing establishments of the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Indian Navy in the region.Superintendent of Police (ATS) Siddharth Korukonda said Gohil, a resident of Lakhpat taluka in Kutch, had since June 2023 sent photos and videos of various BSF and naval facilities in Kutch district to the Pakistani spy via WhatsApp in exchange for money, reported news agency PTI.The Pakistani agent first contacted Gohil, who worked as a contractual health worker at a government centre in Mata No Madh village in Lakhpat, on WhatsApp in June 2023 and befriended him.""After winning his trust, the agent sought photos and videos of BSF and Indian Navy offices and ongoing construction around his village. Gohil shared the requested classified information via WhatsApp,"" said the SP, adding that Gohil knew she was a Pakistani spy.In January 2025, Gohil allegedly used his Aadhaar (unique identification number) to procure a SIM card and shared the OTP with the Pakistani agent, allowing her to operate WhatsApp linked to that number from Pakistan.Acting on a tip-off, the ATS brought Gohil in for questioning a few days ago and sent his phone for forensic analysis, Korukonda said.""Forensic analysis revealed that both the numbers on which Gohil used to share the information are currently being operated from Pakistan. We also learnt that he had received Rs 40,000 cash from an unidentified person sometime ago for sharing that information,"" he said.After the investigation, the ATS arrested Gohil and registered an FIR against him and the Pakistani agent under sections 61 (criminal conspiracy) and 148 (waging war against the government) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the officer added.","Sahdevsinh Gohil, 28, was lured by a Pakistani agent who identified herself as Aditi Bharadwaj.

5 global universities get nod to open campuses in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-global-universities-get-nod-to-open-campuses-in-india/articleshow/121387143.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's push to become a global education hub is gathering momentum, with five foreign universities receiving Letters of Intent (LoIs) to establish campuses in the country. Close to a dozen international institutions by the start of the next academic session are likely to have an Indian campus, according to govt sources.The LoIs - cleared after evaluation by the University Grants Commission - have gone to Victoria University (Australia), University of Liverpool (UK), Western Sydney University (Australia), Illinois Institute of Technology (US) and Istituto Europeo di Design (Italy). In addition, six more are under scrutiny & being evaluated by Liberalized Degree Campuses (LDC) committee.Till now, three foreign universities have established physical campuses in India - Australia's Deakin University and University of Wollongong in Gujarat's GIFT City, and UK's University of Southampton in Gurgaon.""Several universities are in the pipeline. Out of them, five have received LoIs. As per my knowledge, six more are under scrutiny and being evaluated by our LDC committee,"" said union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan in an exclusive conversation.""We've engaged with several top global universities with high QS rankings and strong funding - only such universities will be considered. They must meet all our criteria,"" he added. The upcoming campuses are expected to offer high-quality courses in STEM and management, sectors identified as national priorities.“So far, three foreign universities have come to the country. Two Australian universities are in GIFT City, Gujarat. The University of Southampton is starting its campus in Gurgaon,” said Pradhan in an exclusive conversation, calling the developments “a confirmation of India’s growing global reputation in education.”India’s recent regulatory reforms, driven by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, are transforming the higher education landscape by opening the door to serious foreign investment in a sector long hindered by red tape and restrictive regulations. The NEP envisions India as a global knowledge destination and encourages top-tier foreign universities to establish physical campuses in the country, with a focus on internationalisation, academic excellence, and regulatory liberalisation. Under the University Grants Commission’s new framework, qualified foreign institutions are now allowed to set up campuses independently, design their own curricula, and admit students on their own terms — creating a more flexible and welcoming environment that addresses the earlier concerns of institutions wary of India’s complex legal and administrative systems.Just last week, the Maharashtra government signed an MoU with York University from Canada during the Web Summit, highlighting how state-level initiatives are complementing national policy to attract international collaborations. “The momentum is building. Our intention is not just to allow foreign universities to come, but to bring in the best,” said Pradhan.India’s strategy goes beyond hosting. It includes exporting its educational expertise. IIT Madras has already launched an international campus in Zanzibar, and IIT Delhi in Abu Dhabi. These moves mark a new phase in India’s engagement with global higher education, turning it from a student-sending country into a knowledge-exporting one.The government is also motivated by practical concerns. With lakhs of Indian students spending billions abroad every year, the expansion of globally accredited education within India is seen as a way to retain talent, cut costs for families, and attract international students from neighbouring countries. “This is about making world-class education accessible at home,” Pradhan said.If these initiatives stay on track, India could soon host a vibrant ecosystem of foreign and Indian institutions working side by side — setting a precedent for quality, innovation, and global engagement in higher education.","Close to a dozen international institutions by the start of the next academic session are likely to have an Indian campus.

SHIMLA: A day after Himachal Pradesh high court raised serious questions about an SIT probe under Shimla SP Sanjeev Gandhi and asked CBI to investigate state power corporation general manager Vimal Negi's mysterious death, Gandhi on Saturday attacked DGP Atul Verma for filing an ""ulteriorly motivated affidavit"" in the court in an alleged bid to insult him.Stating that he would rather resign than tolerate insults and questions about his professional integrity, Gandhi said he and members of the SIT had decided to challenge Friday's HC verdict with facts to expose the DGP's motives and how, he claimed, police headquarters had tried to implicate him.The SP said he has filed a petition in the HC seeking action against BJP MLA from Dharamshala Sudhir Sharma for allegedly circulating a video clip of the live-streaming of court proceedings in Negi's death case, held on May 21, without the court's permission. He claimed the MLA did this deliberately to malign his image since he is probing horse-trading allegations against Sharma and others in connection with last year's Rajya Sabha polls. He added that Sharma's action amounts to contempt of proceedings and violates copyright and information laws.In response, Sharma served a legal notice on Gandhi for claiming that he was the mastermind of last year's ""horse-trading"".Sharma told media that his name is not in the FIR pertaining to the alleged horse-trading, and that he was never called for investigation. He accused the Shimla SP of issuing misleading statements against him, asking what stopped police from filing a chargesheet against him if he was involved in horse-trading.Gandhi told reporters on Saturday that the SIT had carried out an honest investigation of Negi's death and that the DGP's status report in court was very irresponsible. He said he would soon expose how investigations conducted under him were being adversely impacted through what he alleged was a ""police headquarters and politico nexus"".He also announced plans to expose senior officers posted at police headquarters for holding a grudge against him. ""Someone wants an extension (service), someone wants posts, but Sanjeev Gandhi needs nothing except justice for Vimal Negi,"" the SP said.Gandhi claimed that the investigation revealed that a member of the DGP's staff has links with the Sanjay Bhuria gang, involved in drug trafficking.The SP also targeted former DGP Sanjay Kundu for allegedly hatching a conspiracy against him and projecting an LPG leak blast at an eatery in the city as an RDX blast through the National Security Guard (NSG) investigation.","Shimla SP Sanjeev Gandhi attacked DGP Atul Verma for filing an ""ulteriorly motivated affidavit"" in the court.

NEW DELHI: The extent to which the legal system can take the poor and the ignorant for a ride, fleecing and exploiting them in the process, came to light when Supreme Court decided to find out the legal expenses of a woman from a small village in West Bengal in her fight to protect her husband. Shocking details emerged: she paid a tout who promised to secure bail and an additional amount to an advocate 'for winning the case'.The woman, who lives in a ramshackle dwelling with a tarpaulin sheet for a roof and no doors, ended up spending Rs 3.5 lakh from the trial court to the SC, which admitted that the legal system had failed her. The man was sentenced to 20 years by a Pocso court for having a physical relationship with the woman when she was a minor, and she fought to get him released.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan had appointed a committee to interact with the woman and the panel filed a report in a sealed envelope. In its judgment, the bench mentioned the findings of the panel which said she was now in a debt trap.""She had to run from pillar to post... She spent large amounts by way of payment of fees to lawyers for his release. The amount she spent as noted in the final report of the committee are startling,"" it said.At different stages, the woman paid a total of Rs 40,000 to advocates. In addition, she claims to have paid a sum of Rs 10,000 to an advocate 'for winning the case'. She spent a sum of Rs 20,000 to get copies of the chargesheet and Rs 7,000 for getting duplicate copies of court papers, court said.She paid Rs 18,000 to a tout who promised to get bail for her husband. Thus, she ended up spending over Rs 2 lakh (in trial court proceedings) by incurring debt for defending the accused. In fact, the committee records that the indebtedness has become vicious, the court said in its verdict.The woman had to approach high court and had to bear additional expenses of nearly Rs 1.4 lakh. As the apex court appointed two leading senior advocates as amici to assist the bench, she did not have to pay much in the SC.""The figures stated make it obvious that she has been exploited. This is evident from the fact that she had to pay Rs 60,000 for grant of bail, Rs 25,000 for securing acquittal, Rs 15,000 for filing a case in this court and Rs 25,000 towards air fare, to enable her husband's advocate to appear before this court,"" the bench said.The top court said that the family is very poor and staying in a temporary shelter enclosed by brick walls, but the roof is of tarpaulin with no door.It said the facts of this case were an eye-opener for everyone as it highlighted the lacunae in the legal system which failed her. ""In this case, the society, the family of the victim and the legal system have done enough injustice to the victim,"" the bench said.","The woman, who lives in a ramshackle dwelling with a tarpaulin sheet for a roof and no doors, ended up spending Rs 3.5 lakh from the trial court to the SC.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has violated the spirit of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India since the treaty came into effect in 1960, India said at the UN to counter what it described as disinformation being carried out by Pakistan over New Delhi's decision to put the IWT in abeyance.India had always acted as a responsible upper riparian state, Indian ambassador P Harish said, adding it was Pakistan that had continued to violate the 1960 treaty. He also highlighted several aspects to expose disinformation and explain why India has finally announced that the treaty will be in abeyance ""until Pakistan, which is a global epicentre of terror, credibly & irrevocably ends its support for cross-border terrorism"". ""In the last four decades, over 20,000 Indian lives have been lost in terror attacks,"" he said.First, Indian ambassador P Harish said, India had entered into the treaty 65-years-ago in good faith and, as the preamble of the treaty says, in spirit of goodwill and friendship. ""Throughout these six-and-a-half decades, Pakistan has violated the spirit of the treaty by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India.Thousands of Indians lost lives in terror attacks, ""the most recent of which was the dastardly targeted terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam last month,"" Harish said, adding that Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism in India sought to hold hostage the lives of civilians, religious harmony and economic prosperity.Second, Harish said that in these 65 years, far-reaching fundamental changes had taken place not only in terms of escalating security concerns through cross-border attacks, but also growing requirements for producing clean energy, climate change and demographic change. ""However, Pakistan has continued to consistently block any changes to this infrastructure, and any modifications of the provisions, which is permissible under the treaty. In fact, in 2012, terrorists even attacked the Tulbul navigation project in J&K,"" he said.Third, he cited Pakistan's reluctance to discuss modifications of the treaty on several occasions in past two years.

NEW DELHI: To ensure that adolescents don't get sent to jail under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) for being in romantic relationships, Supreme Court has directed the Centre to consider decriminalising such consensual relationships and frame a policy for sexual and reproductive health education in the country.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan issued notice to the Centre through the ministry of women and child development to form an expert committee to examine the issue and file a report before it by July 25. The court said it would pass further directions after getting the report.The trigger for the court order was the legal battle of a woman from West Bengal to protect her husband who was sentenced to 20 years in jail under Pocso for having a relationship with her when she was 14.The court had appointed two senior women advocates - Madhavi Divan and Liz Mathew - to assist it on the sensitive issue and they suggested that adolescents in consensual relationships needed to be protected. While Pocso Act served an essential purpose in protecting minors from sexual exploitation, its rigid application in cases of adolescent relationships could lead to outcomes that may not align with the best interests of the prosecutrix and her dependants, they suggested.Accepting the suggestions of the senior advocates, the court impleaded the Centre in the case and issued notice.The advocates also pointed out that various high courts, including Delhi and Madras, have taken a nuanced approach and interpreted the statement of objects and reasons of the Pocso Act as not intending to criminalise consensual romantic relationships. In several cases, Madras high court adopted a legal interpretation that consensual acts did not fulfil the requirement of 'assault' in the offence of 'penetrative sexual assault'.Calcutta HC held that Pocso Act defined 'penetration' as a unilateral act by the accused and, therefore, in cases of consensual intercourse, the act of penetration may not solely be attributed to the accused. Various HCs have also considered the impact such prosecution has on the victim and have proceeded to quash proceedings if pursuing the case would harm the victim.Accepting the suggestions of the senior advocates, the court impleaded Centre in the case and issued notice. ""For carrying forward the suggestion of the learned amici, we propose to implead the Union of India through the ministry of women and child development, so that more effective orders can be passed,"" it said.""The secretary of the ministry shall appoint a committee of experts to deal with the suggestions of the amici curiae. Senior officers of the state shall be part of the committee. If necessary, the committee can also consult the senior counsel appointed as amici curiae. Immediately on service of notice, the secretary shall constitute a committee. The members of the committee constituted by this court (comprising Dr Pekham Basu from TISS; Jayita Saha, clinical psychologist; and Sanjeeb Rakshit, district social welfare officer, South 24 Parganas) shall be permanent invitees to the said committee,"" the bench said.Government should also consider the suggestion to have a policy on comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education because as per a Unesco report, education policies on life skills-based HIV and sexuality education was only at secondary education-level in India, the bench added.Way back in 2001, Madras HC had suggested amending the law not to penalise such relationships. ""An adolescent boy and girl who are in the grips of their hormones and biological changes and whose decision-making ability is yet to fully develop, should essentially receive the support and guidance of their parents and the society at large. These incidents should never be perceived from an adult's point of view and such an understanding will, in fact, lead to lack of empathy. An adolescent boy who is sent to prison in a case of this nature will be persecuted throughout his life. It is high time that the legislature takes into consideration cases of this nature involving adolescents involved in relationships and swiftly bring in necessary amendments under the Act. The legislature has to keep pace with changing societal needs and bring about necessary changes in law and, more particularly, in a stringent law such as Pocso Act,"" it had said.Delhi HC recently in Feb granted relief to a boy and quashed the case against him and had said that the focus of the law should be on preventing exploitation and abuse, rather than punishing love. ""Love is a fundamental human experience, and adolescents have the right to form emotional connections. The law should evolve to acknowledge and respect these relationships, as long as they are consensual and free from coercion,"" HC had said.",Supreme Court orders Centre to consider decriminalising such consensual relationships. Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan issued notice to the Centre through the ministry of women and child development to form an expert committee. The court said it would pass further directions after getting the report.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121386242,imgsize-1044264,width-400,resizemode-4/121386242.jpg"

About Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat (JKP)



PRAYAGRAJ: In the heart of Braj, Kirti Mandir stands as a shining symbol of devotion, architectural brilliance, and humanitarian spirit. Located in Rangeeli Mahal, Barsana Dham, this spiritually resonant temple is the world’s first and only shrine depicting Shri Radha Rani in her divine childhood form, tenderly seated in the lap of her mother Kirti Maiya.Inaugurated on the auspicious day of Basant Panchmi on Feb 10 in 2019, Kirti Mandir was envisioned by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj and brought to completion through the tireless efforts of his daughters and Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat (JKP) presidents — Vishakha Tripathi, Shyama Tripathi and Krishna Tripathi.Built over 12 years, this 80,000-square-foot temple is a true architectural marvel, integrating elements of both Nagara and Dravidian styles without the use of cement or steel. The exterior features pink sandstone intricately carved by master artisans, while the interior is adorned with Italian Carrara marble inlaid with semi-precious stones.A distinctive spiritual element of the temple is the inclusion of 38 devotional couplets from Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj’s compositions Radha Govind Geet and Shyama Shyam Geet, inlaid in marble, making the sacred text a part of the very structure.The sanctum sanctorum houses the unprecedented deity of baby Radha cradled in Kirti Maiya’s lap — a depiction never seen before. Flanking them are idols of Shri Sita Rama and Shri Radha Krishna, with Ashtamahasakhis, Shri Radha Rani's eight eternal companions, enshrined nearby.The temple’s design and spiritual significance echo the deep vatsalya bhava, the sacred maternal love, experienced by Kirti Maiya for Shri Radha. According to scriptural tradition, Kirti Maiya and Vrishabhanu Ji performed penance for over 4.3 million years to receive the divine blessing of being Radha Rani’s parents.The temple is also a centre of visual devotion, with walls adorned by vivid paintings of Shri Radha’s pastimes with her sakhis and Shri Krishna's divine glance filled with love. The temple’s spires are said to radiate Radha’s divine name across the cosmos, making it a beacon for spiritual seekers worldwide.Adjacent to the temple is the Jagadguru Kripalu Chikitsalaya (JKC), which offers 100% free medical services to the underprivileged. At the time of the temple’s inauguration, over 50,000 villagers were provided with essential items in a large-scale distribution drive. This tradition of selfless seva (service) continues to this day through regular health camps and support initiatives.Founded by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj in 1970, JKP is a spiritual, educational, and philanthropic non-profit dedicated to spreading devotion to Radha-Krishna and serving humanity through charitable schools, colleges, hospitals, temples and welfare programs.","Kirti Mandir is the world’s first and only shrine depicting Shri Radha Rani in her divine childhood form.

Special 17: First batch of women cadets set to pass out of NDA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/special-17-first-batch-of-women-cadets-set-to-pass-out-of-nda/articleshow/121385834.cms,"PUNE: Cadet Ishita Sharma stands at a pivotal moment, just a week away from a significant milestone not just for her, but for the country. She is part of the first group of 17 women cadets who will graduate from Pune's National Defence Academy (NDA) on May 30, along with around 300 male counterparts.This achievement marks a historic moment for the armed forces, following their decision to allow women to enter the academy in June 2022.""I come from a non-military background. My parents work in the corporate sector, and my brother is an IT professional. I was pursuing a bachelor's degree in economics when NDA announced its entry for women. I didn't think twice before applying,"" Ishita told TOI.The maiden graduating cadets share the common experience of stringent physical training, military routines, and strong bonds formed over three years at the academy. They echoed that a key aspect of their journey has been personal development, reflecting NDA's reputation for transforming young individuals into accomplished military personnel. ""After spending three years here, I can confidently say that my personality underwent a complete transformation,"" Ishita said.Achieving several accomplishments along the way, Ishita earned the honorary appointment of 'Division Cadet Captain' (DCC) for her outstanding performance in all areas of training.""This is how one gets the opportunity to become a leader right from the academy. It develops your leadership character naturally,"" she remarked.Her fellow cadets echoed similar sentiments about their stint at the academy, acknowledging the significant and transformative impact of training on their confidence.""Before joining the academy, I was an introvert. Here, I made several friends for life. In fact, my course mates feel like family now. I would not have imagined it. You form unbreakable bonds that last forever,"" Ishita said.Cadets emphasised that they never had to compete with their male counterparts for opportunities during their training. ""Equal opportunity naturally empowers each individual. That is what makes the academy unique in all aspects,"" Ishita added.All cadets faced challenges during military training in the initial stages. They worked hard on both physical fitness and overcoming mental barriers. ""Once you break that mental barrier, you push your limits to the next level each time. That is what truly matters, not how many push-ups one can do at a time,"" elaborated Ishita.For cadet Shriti Daksh, the initial weeks brought about a stark realisation about the realities of military training. ""At the academy, I actually understood what the real experience of military training feels like,"" said Shriti, the daughter of a retired wing commander. ""I had no other dream or plan than to join the armed forces.""""It was a significant milestone for me. It was a special day for my father and me when he dropped me off at the academy, a mix of nostalgia and pride for him. Now, I am just a few days away from the moment my father experienced in his life, and I am excited to share that moment with him on May 30,"" Shriti added.Ritul Duhan, the first Battalion Cadet Captain (BCC) from the group, is aware of the responsibility she carries. ""We're not just completing training; we are paving the way for future leadership and inspiring younger cadets.""","First group of 17 women cadets will graduate from Pune's National Defence Academy on May 30.

Punjab CM urges Centre to help resolve water-sharing issues with Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-cm-urges-centre-to-help-resolve-water-sharing-issues-with-haryana/articleshow/121385727.cms,"NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Saturday urged the Centre to step in to resolve water related issues between Punjab and Haryana evn as he denounced the Centre over deployment of CISF at the Bhakra Nangal dam. He also sought Rs 2,829 crore grant to check drug trafficking and upscale border security, and install 50 additional jamming systems to counter drones on the 553 km border with Pakistan.Sources said that while participating in the Niti Aayog’s Governing Council meeting Mann suggested that Centre can convene a meeting between him and his Haryana counterpart on the matters relating to water sharing as they “don’t want to politicise” this.Punjab and Haryana have been at loggerheads over the distribution of water with the AAP govt refusing to share water from Bhakra dam, saying the neighbouring state has already used its share of water.As per an official statement issued by Punjab govt, Mann also flagged the water sharing dispute with Haryana and a “biased” approach against Punjab. It added that the CM reiterated that Punjab has no surplus water for any state.“Asserting that in wake of grim situation of water in the state Yamuna-Sutlej-Link (YSL) canal should be considered for construction instead of the Satluj-Yamuna-Link (SYL) canal, Mann said that Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers are already in deficit and water should be diverted from surplus to deficit basins,” the statement said.It added that Punjab has repeatedly requested to be included in negotiations for the allocation of Yamuna waters as a pact for YSL Project was signed between the erstwhile Punjab and Uttar Pradesh on March 12, 1954 which entitled the erstwhile Punjab to two-third of the Yamuna water. The agreement did not specify the area to be irrigated by Yamuna, he said, adding that before the re-organisation, the Yamuna, like the Ravi and Beas flowed through Punjab.Alleging a “biased” approach of Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), Mann claimed Punjab had been liberal in sharing water with the partner states to meet their drinking water and other needs, even as the state relied upon its groundwater reserves to meet its demands, particularly to irrigate the paddy. He added that now with the upgraded canal structure, Punjab is running short of water and even its share from the rivers is not enough to meet its needs.Mann alleged that the BBMB, despite repeated requests, did not advise other partner states to regulate the release of water to Haryana, and as a result, it exhausted its share by March 30.In his address, CM said that on humanitarian grounds, Punjab decided to release 4,000 cusecs of water to Haryana. However, BBMB ignored the state’s interests and decided to release 8,500 cusecs of water to its neighbour despite serious objections. He called this action against the spirit and provisions of the law and sought BBMB be advised to restrain itself and act within the law.","Punjab and Haryana have been at loggerheads over the distribution of water.

Need to have national resolve Operation Sindoor to achieve Viksit Bharat goal: PM to CMs at NITI meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-to-have-national-resolve-operation-sindoor-to-achieve-viksit-bharat-goal-pm-to-cms-at-niti-meet/articleshow/121385724.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Niti Aayog Governing Council meeting on Saturday, which saw participation of 31 states and UTs, saw “complete unanimity” on Operation Sindoor and there was hardly any sign of political animosity during the day long proceedings. Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the states and UTs to have the same national resolve and spirit for achieving Viksit Bharat as it was for Operation Sindoor.“The PM in his remark said that we need to have the same approach that we had in supporting Operation Sindoor to go and achieve the goal of Viksit Bharat. The strength of Team India as shown in Operation Sindoor also is going to be the same feature which will enable India to achieve Viksit Bharat. He also said Operation Sindoor is not just the show of the Army's strength, it has to be converted to social strength. Similarly, Viksit Bharat is not the idea of chief ministers or anybody in the system; it has to be converted to a people’s movement,” Niti Aayog CEO B V R Subrahmanyam told reporters while adding that the meeting was most successful.This was PM’s first meeting with CMs and Lieutenant Governors after Operation Sindoor. Leaders lauded the military operation for its precision and impact on terrorist infrastructure, as well as the progress in defence industry’s self-reliance under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.In his address, Modi said the operation must not be viewed as a one-off. “We must adopt a long-term approach,” he said, calling for modernisation of civil preparedness. “Recent mock drills have reignited attention to civil defence. States should institutionalise civil defence preparedness,” he added.The meeting saw participation of CMs of both NDA and opposition-ruled states, including M K Stalin (Tamil Nadu), A Revanth Reddy (Telangana), Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu (Himachal Pradesh), Hemant Soren (Jharkhand), Bhagwant Mann (Punjab), and Lalduhoma (Mizoram). Absent from the meeting were CMs of Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal, Bihar, and Puducherry. Among NDA leaders present were N Chandrababu Naidu (Andhra Pradesh), Conrad Sangma (Meghalaya), and Neiphiu Rio (Nagaland).Reiterating the Centre-state coordination, Modi said, “If Centre and states work together like Team India, no goal is impossible,” he said. Sources said there was unanimity among states that there should be “no politics over development” and everyone is committed to accelerate growth.While BJP CMs from Delhi, Odisha and Goa echoed the vision of Viksit Bharat, Telangana CM Revanth Reddy proposed forming a national task force, headed by PM and comprising key chief ministers, to fully harness the economic potential of India’s six major metros — Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai, and Hyderabad. Naidu proposed forming three Centre-State sub-groups focused on GDP growth, population management, and artificial intelligence.Though Stalin, Mann and Soren raised state specific issues, officials said there was sign of any face off. J&K CM Omar Abdullah said that the “darkness” prevailing in the UT after the Pahalgam attack will lift soon and they are confident of the “light” returning again.","The Niti Aayog Governing Council meeting on Saturday, which saw participation of 31 states and UTs, saw “complete unanimity” on Operation Sindoor.

Govt on Waqf Act in SC: Proof of being Muslim in sync with Sharia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-on-waqf-act-in-sc-proof-of-being-muslim-in-sync-with-sharia/articleshow/121348573.cms,"No mention of 'waqf by user' term in 1923 Act: Raj govt to SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order after arguments over three days between the Centre and petitioners for and against the validity of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. Responding to the petitioners' objection to the provision that only a practising Muslim for five years could dedicate properties for waqf, SG Tushar Mehta said it was in sync with the requirement of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.Given the widespread misuse of waqf properties and their usurpation for personal purposes noted from 1870s, registration of waqf properties, including 'waqf by user', needed to be mandatorily registered under the 1923 and 1995 Waqf Acts, he said. Mehta said a person could be governed by the 1937 Act only if he satisfied the prescribed authority that he was a Muslim and filled a form before that authority declaring that he desired to follow Sharia law and be governed by its provisions - ranging from marriage to waqfs. ""So, what is the problem in the new law asking a person to be mandatorily a Muslim for the purpose of making a waqf?"" he asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported by A M Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and Huzefa Ahmadi, said the way the new waqf law was drafted, it would allow govt to take over 'waqf by user' properties, which were not registered for decades because of fault of state govts, an eventuality which would result in punishing the community for no fault of its.Sibal said waqf was part of zakat, one of the 5 cardinal principles intrinsic to Islam. ""Waqf was purely religious, and no authority could interfere in this as the Constitution guarantees that every religious denomination has the absolute right to manage its religious institutions, which in this case is waqf,"" he added.Appearing for Rajasthan, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said 'waqf by user' was a term evolved by Privy Council and did not find mention in the 1923 Waqf Act. There was no dedication to Allah in case of 'waqf by user', he said. For ST Muslim organisation, Odisha, and a waqf board, senior advocates Ranjit Kumar, Maninder Singh and Gopal Sankaranarayanan supported Centre's stand.An advocate brought to the court's notice that in Tamil Nadu's Tiruchendurai, its 1,500-year-old Chola-era temple and the surrounding area had been declared waqf property by TN waqf board. She said the board's claim was met with resistance from villagers, who were unable to sell their land without the board's approval. She said the new law would curb such practices.","Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order.

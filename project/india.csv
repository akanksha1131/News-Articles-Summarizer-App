BHUBANESWAR Two wives, two deaths, Rs 2 crore insurance cover. The double life of Odisha police constable Deepak Kumar Rout, 39, is under the scanner following his arrest for murder of his 25-year-old second wife, traffic constable Subhamitra Sahoo, who was found buried in a pit meant to pass off as a toilet.Subhamitra's body was exhumed in Keonjhar Wednesday, leading to arrest of her husband and two others, his relative Binod Bihari Bhuyan (28), and landowner Sambhunath Mohanta, who allegedly took Rs 5,000 to let Rout bury her on his plot. Mohanta hired a machine to dig the pit, misleading the operator that it was for toilet construction.The killing reopened old wounds. On Thursday, the family of Rout's first wife Aparna Priyadarshini, a revenue inspector, who died in a road crash in March 2022, lodged a complaint in Dhenkanal alleging she too was murdered. They claimed Rout tortured Aparna, coerced her into loans of over Rs 10 lakh, and later collected Rs 1 crore in insurance after her death. Subhamitra was also insured for Rs 1 crore. DCP Jagmohan Meena said Rout hatched the plan to murder Subhamitra on Aug 26 after rows over money with her, whom he had married in July.","Odisha police constable Deepak Kumar Rout, 39, is under the scanner following his arrest for murder of his 25-year-old second wife.

Bombay HC nixes PIL against Maharashtra order to issue Kunbi caste certs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-nixes-pil-against-maharashtra-order-to-issue-kunbi-caste-certs/articleshow/123988465.cms,"Mumbai: Observing there is a need to discourage the trend of multiplicity of litigation, Bombay HC Thursday dismissed a PIL challenging Maharashtra govt's decision to issue Kunbi caste certificates to members of Maratha community. ""It is in the larger public interest that there should not be multiplicity of litigations, where different individuals file applications one after the other under the guise of public interest,"" HC said.A bench of CJ Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad remarked that the petitioner, an advocate from SC community, was not an aggrieved party. The state advocate general Birendra Saraf submitted that over half a dozen petitions were already pending before various benches, challenging the same GR. Saraf said the GR doesn't pertain to SC certificates. ""It simply sets up a mechanism to facilitate an enquiry into whether a Maratha individual can prove Kunbi ancestry. It does not affect the SCs in any manner,"" he said. The PIL was originally intended to give a voice to the voiceless masses or sections of society, the HC orally observed and added, ""A writ petition, claiming to be a PIL involving a subject matter of this nature, is clearly not in the category of cases where the writ court should grant indulgence.

SC tells states to make rules for regn of Sikh marriages in 4 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-tells-states-to-make-rules-for-regn-of-sikh-marriages-in-4-months/articleshow/123988343.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that ""in a secular republic, the State must not turn a citizen's faith into either a privilege or a handicap"", Supreme Court has pulled up states and UTs for not framing rules for registration of Sikh marriages (Anand Karaj) and directed them to do it within four months.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta ordered that till the states frame rules, the registration of Anand Karaj marriages should be done without discrimination under the prevailing marriage registration framework.The Anand Marriage Act was enacted to recognise the validity of marriages performed by the Sikh ceremony of Anand Karaj. By the Amendment of 2012, Parliament inserted Section 6 of the Act, casting a duty on respective state govts to make rules to facilitate registration of such marriages, maintain a marriage register, and provide certified extracts, while clarifying that failure to register it would not affect the validity of an Anand marriage. As many states and UTs failed to implement the law in more than a decade, the apex court intervened and passed directives.""The fidelity of a constitutional promise is measured not only by the rights it proclaims, but by the institutions that make those rights usable. In a secular republic, the State must not turn a citizen's faith into either a privilege or a handicap. When the law recognises Anand Karaj as a valid form of marriage yet leaves no machinery to register it, the promise is only half kept.What remains is to ensure that the route from rites to record is open, uniform and fair,"" SC said. The Supreme Court said Section 6 of the Act discloses a complete legislative scheme and the provision, intended as an imperative, identifies the facilitative purpose of registration.""It requires the keeping of a public register with certified extracts, provides for laying of rules before the state legislature, and removes the burden of duplicative registration once an entry is made under the Act.","The Anand Marriage Act was enacted to recognise the validity of marriages performed by the Sikh ceremony of Anand Karaj.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan set up another politically charged clash with arch-rivals India after securing a 41-run win over the United Arab Emirates in Dubai on Wednesday. The result confirmed both teams’ progression from Group A into the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup.With the win, Pakistan finished the group stage with 4 points from 3 games, slotting in alongside India, who top the standings with 4 points from 2 games and are yet to play Oman on Friday.

LUDHIANA: In a village on the outskirts of Ludhiana, a crime was uncovered that was as grisly as it was puzzling — a 71-year-old NRI travelled from the US to marry her sunset love, only to allegedly be bludgeoned to death by a man hired by her would-be groom, a 75-year-old settled in the UK.Rupinder Kaur was allegedly killed by the very man whose roof she shared in Kila Raipur village (15km from Ludhiana). Her body was burnt and the remains flung into a nullah, say police.What gave away the gruesome crime was a fresh coat of paint and new floor tiles at the home of the alleged killer, Sukhjit Singh alias Sonu, a typist in Ludhiana district court.Read also: ‘Beaten to death with baseball bat’: Inside the grisly murder of 71-year-old NRI Rupinder Kaur in Ludhiana The case registered by Ludhiana Police names him and UK-based Charanjit Singh. Sukhjit is in custody and charged with murder. Charanjit is in the UK. It's not known if police have contacted him.Police said Charanjit had backed out of the marriage and got Rupinder killed because she wouldn't take no for an answer and had threatened to implicate him in a case if he refused. Police sources told TOI the motive was still a grey area.Sukhjit filed a complaint on Aug 18, reporting Rupinder missing. He said she had given her power of attorney to deal with her civil/criminal cases about six months ago, and that she arrived in India in early-July.Sukhjit claimed Rupinder lived in his house for about 10 days and left for Delhi on July 18, saying she would fly to Canada to attend a wedding. However, he claimed he hadn't been able to contact her since then.Deputy commissioner (city, rural) Rupinder Singh said, ""Police found the NRI woman was murdered by Sukhjit at the behest of her NRI friend, Charanjit Singh. Probe revealed she had relations with Charanjit, and he initially wanted to marry her. Rupinder faced an FIR at NRI police station in a cheating case and was declared a proclaimed offender. Charanjit introduced her to Sukhjit for court-related work.""""Rupinder would pay Sukhjit via bank transactions. It is yet to be checked how much and for what purpose,"" said the officer. Police say Rupinder and Charanjit met often in India and abroad, and they had their pictures to prove it.Sukhjit claimed Charanjit told him Rupinder threatened to implicate Charanjit in a rape case and Sukhjit in a cheating case. ""Charanjit lured Sukhjit by offering him Rs 50 lakh to kill Rupinder. He also offered to call Sukhjit to UK. When Sukhjit agreed to execute the murder, Charanjit asked Rupinder to travel to India, promising to marry her there,"" added the officer.On July 12, Sukhjit beat Rupinder to death with a baseball bat. ADCP-II Karanveer Singh said, ""The accused got a large amount of coal and started a fire. He put the woman's body on it to burn it, which took two-three days. He put the skeletal remains in sacks and dumped them in a water channel. He hammered her mobile to pieces and dumped it too. Police have recovered some of the remains and the hammer.""Asked how police cracked the case, a senior officer said since Sukhjit used coal inside his house, the room got damaged. Some labourers from the village were hired to repair it. ""The village was already abuzz about the missing NRI woman, and here was a soot-blackened room. It made people suspect him. Someone tipped off police.""TOI contacted Rupinder's sister Kamal Kaur, who also lives abroad. She said she had approached local police after failing to contact her for several days.Police say Charanjit and Sukhjit had known each other for decades.

‘Obey Immigration Laws Or…’: Trump’s Stark Warning After ‘Humiliating’ ICE Raid On U.S. Ally





An immigration judge in Louisiana has ordered pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the US, to be deported to Syria or Algeria for allegedly failing to disclose certain information on his green card application, according to court documents filed Wednesday by his lawyers.Khalil’s attorneys indicated they plan to appeal the deportation order but expressed concern that the process would likely be swift and unfavorable.The ruling by Immigration Judge Jamee Comans comes despite a separate federal court order in New Jersey that blocks Khalil’s deportation while the court considers his claim that his detention and deportation are unlawful retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians, as reported by Politico.Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student who helped organize pro-Palestinian campus protests, was arrested on March 8 at his Manhattan residence and detained in Louisiana.He has not been charged with any crime. His arrest was part of the President Donald Trump administration’s wider effort to target foreign-born pro-Palestinian academics legally studying or working in the US.In a letter to New Jersey Federal Judge Michael Farbiarz, Khalil’s lawyers said they have 30 days from September 12, the date of the Louisiana judge’s ruling, to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).They noted that the BIA process is typically fast and that appeals to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals are rarely successful, particularly for stays of removal for noncitizens.“As a result,” the lawyers wrote, “the only meaningful impediment to Petitioner’s physical removal from the United States would be this Court’s important order prohibiting removal during the pendency of his federal habeas case.” They further added that nothing else would preserve his lawful permanent resident status.In a statement, Khalil, originally from Syria, criticized the Trump administration of using 'fascist tactics'.“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” he said.Earlier this year, Khalil spent more than three months in detention after the Trump administration invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows deportation of noncitizens, even legal permanent residents if the Secretary of State determines their presence harms US foreign policy interests.In June, Judge Farbiarz, a former President Joe Biden appointee, blocked Khalil’s deportation on foreign policy grounds and ordered his release, determining he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. Khalil then returned to New York, reuniting with his wife, a US citizen and their newborn son, who was born during his detention.The Trump administration has since pursued Khalil’s deportation on another basis, alleging that he failed to fully disclose his past employment and memberships in certain organizations on his green card application.","Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student who helped organize pro-Palestinian campus protests, was arrested on March 8 at his Manhattan residence.

MobiKwik loses Rs 40 crore in 48 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mobikwik-loses-rs-40-crore-in-48-hours/articleshow/123933014.cms,"GURGAON: Taking advantage of what is believed to be a glitch that blindsided city-based digital wallet company MobiKwik's systems, around Rs 40 crore were allegedly siphoned off over two days, Sept 11 and 12, from the company's account through a blitz of UPI transactions.The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money. Uncannily, this is the second time this has happened to MobiKwik. In Oct 2017, the company was allegedly similarly defrauded of around Rs 19 crore with the money being moved to thousands of personal bank accounts. This time, the glitch happened after the company updated its software earlier this month, investigators said. It apparently allowed Mobikwik users to send much higher amounts of money than their wallet balances. Transactions, the investigators said, also went through if users entered incorrect PINs.Police said how scamsters came to know about this glitch is under probe. Officials said they suspected insiders' involvement. The fraud was reported on Sept 13 by a MobiKwik employee, citing an audit that had detected suspicious transactions on Sept 11 and 12.According to cops, fraudulent transfers over those two hours amounted to Rs 40.2 crore. ""Nearly 5 lakh transactions took place on Sept 11-12, and so far, 2,500 bank beneficiary accounts have been identified. We have managed to freeze Rs 8 crore out of the total fraud amount. This money was deposited in these bank accounts,"" said a source.Five of the arrested men are from Nuh. The other is from Palwal. The accused have been identified as Rehan, Waqar Yunus, Wasim Akram, Mohd Amir, Mohd Ansar and Mohd Sakil. All six have been sent to judicial custody.Police spokesperson Ashok Kumar said if any company employee is found to be involved in the scam, strict action will be taken against the individual. Nuh police on Tuesday, meanwhile, asked people to report by Sept 23 any unexplained cash transfers they might have received in their accounts.""If anyone received transactions on Sept 11 and 12 due to technical security lapses or other reasons via the Mobikwik app or received unauthorised payments through the app and wishes to return them, or has any complaints related to such transactions, they can visit the office of the SP. People from Palwal district and other Mewat areas can also come."" Nuh police said in a statement.

Trump repeats claim he stopped India-Pak war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-repeats-claim-he-stopped-india-pak-war/articleshow/123983639.cms,"LONDON: US President Donald Trump repeated his claim at a press conference at Chequers, the UK PM’s official country retreat, that his intervention had stopped the brief India-Pakistan conflict earlier this year, a claim refuted umpteen times by India.Trump, speaking on the final day of his state visit to Britain, said he personally had stopped seven wars since coming to power. “Most were not thought to be settleable but we did India, we did Pakistan, two nuclear powers. That was purely for trade. We told them if you want to trade with us, you will have to get along, and they were going at it hot and heavy,” he said. He added he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he could not add the war in Ukraine to that list.“If the price of oil comes down, Putin will have no choice but to drop out of that war,” he said as he and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed to ramp up the pressure on Putin. “When I found out that the European nations were buying oil from Russia, I am very close to India and to the PM of India, I wished him a Happy Birthday the other day, we have a very good relationship, but I sanctioned them (India). I am willing to do other things, but not when the people I am fighting for are buying oil from Russia.That’s not playing fair with the USA,” he said.He also said the US is trying to get Bagram airbase back from Afghanistan as it is in a strategic position an hour away from where China makes nuclear weapons. “We were supposed to leave with strength and dignity and keep Bagram,” he said.On Gaza, Trump said he opposed a Palestinian state whilst Hamas still had Israeli hostages, calling it a point of disagreement with Starmer.The pair had earlier held bilateral talks, attended a business reception and toured the Winston Churchill Archives. Trump is a big Churchill fan.US tech and finance giants have announced £150 billion (Rs 17.2 lakh crore) in investments in the UK, creating 7,600 jobs to coincide with the state visit, including plans to build in the UK the largest AI supercomputer in Europe.The First Lady and Queen Camilla looked around Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House at Windsor Castle, the largest dolls’ house in the world, designed by Edwin Lutyens. It contains a fully stocked wine cellar, working lifts, running water and a miniature library with 200 original works hand-written by famous writers. Melania particularly liked “The Gruffalo”.At the state banquet on Wednesday, Trump hailed the British Empire laying the foundations of “law, liberty, free speech and individual rights virtually everywhere the Union Jack has ever flown”.“Together, we’ve done more good for humanity than any two countries in all of history,” he said.","US President Donald Trump said he personally had stopped seven wars since coming to power. “Most were not thought to be settleable but we did India, we did Pakistan, two nuclear powers.

NEW DELHI: A video from Amritsar is going viral on social media, where a foreign tourist confronted a local man for asking his wife’s phone number without her consent. The woman said the man approached them and directly requested her contact details, which she found intrusive and inappropriate.In the video, the tourist questions the man, saying, “Why are you asking for her phone number? What you did is very strange. You are very strange. You approach a random female by herself and ask for her phone number within two seconds; that's very strange. Yeah, you shouldn't do that again, ok. You are a bit crazy.”The man, who identified himself as a student, tried to ease the tension by referring to the woman as “sister” before walking away abruptly.(The TOI couldn't independently verify the authenticity of this video.)The video has attracted widespread attention, with many social media users expressing frustration over such behavior and its impact on the city and country’s reputation, known for its cultural heritage and hospitality.One user shared, “I am not surprised, last year I went on a road trip with my then gf and people wouldn't stop asking her for photos, this was when I was with her! If she were alone, I could only assume how much worse it would have been.A couple of them even asked me to get them to be 'friends' with her.”Another commented, “I just went through a similar experience with a friend who recently visited India. Morons would walk up to her and ask her for a selfie, even the women! I would then have to rudely shoo them away. I had to explain to her that it's perfectly normal to just ignore people. Incidents like these just tarnish the image of the nation!”A third user criticized the man’s attempt to deflect responsibility, stating, “So after harassing an unknown person, you can just get away by saying 'sister'?”One woman questioned the recurring pattern, saying, “Why are Indian Men like this! In Amritsar an Indian man was caught asking for the phone number of ‘Gori Mam’. And what is this πJeet behaviour in the end.”Similar reports have surfaced from other parts of India, including an incident involving a Dutch woman who was harassed on a train traveling from Delhi to Agra.These incidents have reignited conversations about respecting women in public spaces and the need for greater awareness and sensitivity.","A video from Amritsar is going viral on social media, where a foreign tourist confronted a local man for asking his wife’s phone number without her consent.

Poll Do you think the media has played a fair role in reporting on the crash? Yes, they have been unbiased. No, they have sensationalized the story.

NEW DELHI: The father of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the Air India Ahmedabad crash in June this year, has called for a 'formal investigation' by the central government while criticising the findings of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as well as the ""selective leaks"" that ""tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation"".In the Ahmedabad plane crash, which was one of the worst aircraft accidents in India, 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed. Air India's Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171 to London Gatwick crashed soon after take off from Ahmedabad on June 12.In a letter to the civil aviation secretary and AAIB Director General, 91-year-old Pushkaraj Sabharwal said that selective leaks about the accident had led to speculation that Sumeet (56) was under tremendous psychological pressure and contemplating suicide, PTI reported.""These innuendos have very adversely affected my health and mental setup and the reputation of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal. They tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation, which is a fundamental right guaranteed to a citizen of India under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,"" the letter, dated August 29, said.Pushkaraj has demanded that the central government order a formal enquiry into the accident under Rule 12 of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017, which empowers the Centre to institute a formal investigation into the circumstances of any accident of an Indian-registered aircraft if it appears expedient to hold such a probe.There were no immediate comments from the civil aviation ministry or the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on the letter.Amid speculation about the cause of the fatal crash following the release of its preliminary probe report on July 12, the AAIB had asserted it was too early to draw any “definite conclusions” as the investigation was still on and that the final report would identify root causes. The agency also urged everyone to refrain from spreading premature narratives.""The preliminary report on the contrary does not allude to the 'what' happened or the bare facts of the crash, instead resorting to insinuations on the one hand and offering copious clean chits to the manufacturer/s on the other. The report in its present form is deficient, diversionary & discrepant,"" the letter said.It further alleged that selective information from the preliminary investigation — including contents of the cockpit voice recorder — had been put into the public domain.Pushkaraj also refuted speculation about his son’s mental health. Citing reports, he said it was suggested Sumeet was divorced and that caused him anxiety and depression.""It even ignores the fact that Captain Sabharwal was divorced about 15 years ago. The other speculation relating to the cause for Captain Sabharwal being desirous of committing suicide has been his mother's death. His mother died more than three years ago. After that, Captain Sabharwal had operated more than 100 flights without any incident or accident.""It is most pertinent to note that in over 25 years of flying, Captain Sabharwal had not had a single incident or accident-causing fatalities or otherwise,"" the letter said.He had almost 15,638.22 hours of flying experience, of which 8,596 hours were on the 787-8. He was also designated as a Pilot Trainer — a Line Training Captain — and held the DGCA licence for that purpose.Pushkaraj added that the absence of a formal enquiry under Rule 12, coupled with selective information being provided to the media, was very disturbing and detrimental to him and affected his fundamental rights, including the right to the reputation of his deceased son.In the preliminary report, AAIB had said the fuel supply to both engines of the plane was cut off within a gap of one second, causing confusion in the cockpit soon after takeoff. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut off. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,"" it had said.","The father of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the Air India Ahmedabad crash in June this year, has called for a 'formal investigation' He criticises the findings of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as well as the ""selective leaks"" that ""tarnish his reputation"" 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123945567,imgsize-165992,width-400,resizemode-4/ahmedabad-plane-crash.jpg"

Why Kerala?

How Kerala Is Responding

Lessons For The World

On Sept 1, two patients — a threemonth-old baby and a 52-year-old woman — died within hours of each other at Kozhikode Govt Medical College. Doctors confirmed that both were being treated for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), an infection caused by the free-living parasite Naegleria fowleri.By mid-Sept, the toll had risen to 19, with 69 suspected or confirmed cases across Kerala. Victims ranged from infants to middle-aged adults. The scale is extraordinary: globally, researchers have identified only 488 documented infections since 1962.PAM is one of the deadliest infections known to science. The parasite lives in warm, stagnant freshwater — ponds, lakes, unchlorinated swimming pools, poorly maintained tanks — and can infect people only when contaminated water is forced up the nose. From there, it travels along the olfactory nerve, burrows into the brain and begins dissolving tissue, unleashing catastrophic inflammation.Symptoms can begin in one to 12 days (typically 3-7 days): fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. Within days, they give way to stiff neck, confusion, seizures, hallucinations and coma.Across six decades, fewer than 20 survivors are documented globally, most with lasting neurological damage.The fatality rate is 97%.There is no vaccine or proven cure. Drugs such as Amphotericin B, Azoles, or Miltefosine are used in combination, sometimes with induced hypothermia, but success is rare. Crucially, PAM does not spread person to person and is not caused by drinking contaminated water; infection occurs via the noseWorldwide, PAM tends to appear as sporadic, one-off cases, usually tied to a single contaminated reservoir or swimming pool. Kerala’s outbreak is different. Cases have surfaced across Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Malappuram, with no single identified source.The state’s position as a public health bellwether makes the outbreak more unsettling. Kerala has often been the first to detect emerging threats: India’s first Nipah outbreak in 2018, its early Covid-19 cases in 2020 (detected in returning medical students from Wuhan), and Zika virus in 2021. The arrival of a rare, near-uniformly fatal amoeba on this list has alarmed both doctors and the public.“Eight people died in 15 days. What is the protocol? What are people supposed to do? Even a baby was infected — was that child in a swimming pool?” Opposition leader V D Satheesan asked in the state assembly this month.Protests have broken out in several districts, with residents demanding that wells and public taps be tested. Doctors caution that Kerala’s higher numbers also reflect better detection. “The symptoms — headache, fever and vomiting — are similar to bacterial and viral brain infections. If you don’t suspect amoeba, you’ll miss it completely,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, convener of the Indian Medical Association’s research cell.Amid mounting panic, Kerala has launched ‘Jalamanu Jeevan (Water is Life)’, a statewide chlorination drive covering wells, pools, etc. Schools have been told to disinfect storage units regularly, while panchayats and municipalities are checking public taps and wells.Hospitals, particularly in Kozhikode, Thrissur and Malappuram, are on high alert. Doctors have been instructed to treat any meningitis-like illness with a history of water exposure as potential PAM. Rapid-response teams have been sent to test community water sources, though no contaminated reservoir has been found yet.Drugs, including Miltefosine, have been stocked. But officials concede that treatment rarely saves lives. Survivors worldwide are exceptional, often treated with a cocktail of antifungals, antibiotics and cooling therapies. That is why prevention — keeping contaminated water out of the nose — remains the focus.A 2025 review in the Journal of Infection and Public Health, which analysed 488 cases across 39 countries since the disease was first described, shows how there is little room for error — and what others can learn as climate change reshapes risk. The parasite is not the same everywhere: N. fowleri has multiple genetic strains; genotypes II and III predominate in Asia, North America and Europe.Clean water is the strongest defence: Free chlorine ≥ 2.0 mg/L in storage tanks/ pools can eliminate the amoeba; countries like Australia monitor disinfection as a routine public health practice.Surveillance changes the numbers: Strong labs and routine testing mean more detection (not necessarily more disease). Country tallies include India (26), Mexico (33), Czech Republic (17), New Zealand (9), Nigeria (4), Venezuela (7).Everyday habits can raise or reduce risk: In Pakistan, first cases were reported in Karachi in 2008; >140 cases have since been documented. Many were linked to nasal rinsing during ablution or showering, not swimming. A similar ablution-linked case has also been confirmed in the US.","Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is caused by the free-living parasite Naegleria fowleri.

NEW DELHI: The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has formally taken up the probe into alleged irregularities in the construction of former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's official residence on Flag Staff Road, a senior Delhi govt official.Two complaints lodged in 2024 by then leader of opposition in assembly and current speaker Vijender Gupta have been taken up by CVC after the chief vigilance officer of Central Public Works Department submitted his report. ""The apex anti-corruption body will ascertain accountability and determine future course of action,"" the official said. AAP did not comment on the matter.Gupta had allged irregularities in the construction and renovation of the CM's official residence at 6 Flag Staff Road, Civil Lines. The complaints were formally registered by CVC after the CPWD vigilance probe.The first complaint, filed in Oct, alleged illegal construction and regulatory violations in the house. Gupta alleged that there was unauthorised demolition of eight Type-V govt flats at Rajpur Road, and two govt bungalows (8A and 8B, Flag Staff Road) were amalgamated into the residence, creating a complex of nearly 8 acres without the mandatory statutory approvals.He also alleged that tenders were floated under the description of ""additions and alterations"", whereas, in reality, an entirely new structure was constructed in violation of building norms. He further alleged environmental breaches, stating that several trees were felled without the requisite clearance.The second complaint, filed in the same month, alleged misuse of public funds in renovation of the residence, claiming that crores of rupees were spent.During the Delhi assembly elections in Feb, BJP had targeted AAP on the issue, calling the renovated bungalow, ""Sheesh Mahal"". The party alleged that lavish modifications and refurbishment of the house, where Kejriwal stayed during most of his tenure as CM, showed AAP had abandoned its principles of ""representing the common man and austerity"".In 2022, the vigilance department initiated an inquiry, on LG V K Saxena's direction, into alleged irregularities and cost escalation in the renovation.AAP, in its defence, had earlier said the house was in very bad condition and needed urgent repairs; otherwise, there could have been accidents. It dismissed BJP's allegations and said whatever expenses were incurred were for the CM's house, which anyone, even after Kejriwal, would have used.","Two complaints lodged in 2024 by then leader of opposition in assembly and current speaker Vijender Gupta have been taken up by CVC.

He said it would be against Hindu rituals and would hurt religious sentiments.Petitioner H S Gaurav said the inauguration of Dasara inside the Chamundeshwari temple is not a mere ceremonial opening, but a sacred ritual that begins with the 'agamic puja' of Goddess Chamundeshwari, performed by the inaugurating dignitary. Performance of this puja by a Muslim would hurt sentiments of millions of Hindus in Karnataka and across the world, he said.Before the HC, the state through its advocate general K Shashikiran Shetty, had referred to a 2016 circular of state govt declaring that all temples coming under the jurisdiction of the department of religious endowments of the state, as well as private temples, were required to grant free entry to all for 'darshan' of the deity, without distinction of caste, community, religion or gender.Shetty said the Dasara festival at the temple is a state-sponsored function and is not a religious function of the temple or religious institution, and hence, invitation to a personality cannot be objected to on the ground of religion.Dismissing the plea, Chief Justice Vibhu Bakhru, said: ""The petitioner's right to practise and propagate religion is not curtailed in any manner by extending invitation to Banu Mushtaq to inaugurate the Dasara festivities.""",Booker Prize winner Banu Mushtaq to be chief guest for Dasara festival.

NEW DELHI: In a matrimonial dispute extending beyond India, the Supreme Court has given interim custody of a child to his father, who lives in India, saying the boy's mother took courts in both India and the UK for a ride and never intended to let their son meet his father.The woman, who had moved to the UK to escape a discordant marital life and pursue a career, deceitfully told both a British court and the Punjab and Haryana High Court that her daughter and son were living with her in England when she had actually left her son with her parents in Sonepat, Haryana. She went to great lengths to conceal from her estranged husband their son is living with her parents in Sonepat -- she hid the boy's location and background whenever his father called to speak.When the father grew suspicious and went to the parents-in-law's house, he found his son living there but was beaten by them.The UK HC had criticised the woman saying: ""It is clear from the above that the mother lured the court into error by failing to disclose that she had only removed Miss N to the UK and that Master K remained in India. This crude subterfuge, which was always going to be found out, does the mother no credit at all.""Against this backdrop, the father moved the Punjab and Haryana HC for custody of his son, which was granted to him. The woman, her parents and her brother challenged the HC order before the SC.A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi, noted an interesting fact in the unusual cross-country matrimonial litigation: the woman had filed for divorce in the UK, which was opposed by the husband.

BHOPAL: What began as a frantic river rescue in MP's Rajgarh district a fortnight ago, has unraveled into an elaborate fraud - Vishal Soni, son of Rajgarh BJP leader Mahesh Soni, fabricated his own death to evade Rs 1.40 crore in loans, sending police, administration, and SDERF teams on a 10-day, 20-km search of the Kalisindh River, even as he remained hidden in Maharashtra.The drama began unfolding on Sept 5, when police received information about a car sinking in the Kalisindh river. Divers retrieved the vehicle, only to find it empty. The car was identified as belonging to Vishal Soni, prompting a large-scale rescue mission. Following allegations of negligence by Vishal's father, three separate teams scoured the river for nearly two weeks, covering a 20-km stretch.When no sign of Vishal emerged after eight days, suspicions deepened. Station house officer Akanksha Hada obtained Vishal's mobile call detail records, which revealed his location in Maharashtra.Acting swiftly, MP police - assisted by their counterparts in Maharashtra - apprehended Vishal in the Fardapur police station area of Sambhaji Nagar district.During interrogation, Vishal confessed to owning six trucks and two public vehicles but being overwhelmed by debts exceeding Rs 1.40 crore.""I was told that if I got a death certificate, the bank loans would be waived,"" he reportedly told police.On September 5, at 5 am, Vishal collected money from his truck driver near Gopalpura, drove to the riverbank, switched off his car's headlights, and pushed the vehicle into the river before fleeing on the driver's bike to Indore. Reading newspaper reports of his own ""death,"" he traveled to Shirdi and Shani Shingnapur.When news reached him that police had traced his location, Vishal attempted to stage a kidnapping by tearing his clothes, rolling in dust, and filing a false report at Fardapur police station.Two days prior to his arrest, police had questioned Vishal's father and brothers, who admitted suspecting he was staying with relatives. Police noted that there was no direct constitutional provision to penalise a man for faking his own death, so Vishal was handed over to his family without a formal case.","Vishal Soni fabricated his own death to evade Rs 1.40 crore in loans.

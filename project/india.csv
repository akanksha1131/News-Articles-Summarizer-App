Pushpa 2: The Rule

NEW DELHI: Telangana Congress MLA R Bhoopathi Reddy issued a stern warning to actor Allu Arjun , cautioning him against making critical remarks about chief minister Revanth Reddy .The MLA from Nizamabad (Rural) on Tuesday threatened that the actor’s films might be boycotted in the state if he continued his comments. “If you (Allu Arjun) talk about our chief minister, be cautious. You are from Andhra. You came here to live,” Bhoopathi Reddy said. “What is your contribution to Telangana? We are issuing a 100 per cent warning. If you don't mend your ways, we will not let your films run in Telangana,” he added.The MLA also criticised Allu Arjun’s blockbuster, labelling it ""a smuggler’s story"" that lacked societal benefit. He further highlighted Congress’ historical support for the film industry , citing how past governments had provided land in Hyderabad to bolster its development.The remarks follow escalating tensions between Allu Arjun and chief minister Revanth Reddy after a tragic incident during the December 4 screening ofat Hyderabad’s Sandhya Theatre. A stampede at the venue led to the death of a 35-year-old woman, Revathi, and left her eight-year-old son, Sri Tej, hospitalised in critical condition.Chief minister Revanth Reddy lashed out at the actor during an assembly session, accusing Allu Arjun and his production team of being ""inhuman"" towards the victim’s family. The CM questioned whether film stars or political figures enjoyed immunity from prosecution, vowing that the government would hold those responsible for the incident accountable.“Allu Arjun was denied permission for the visit by the police, yet he went ahead. As long as I am in office, my primary responsibility is to protect the lives of people,” the chief minister said.Also read: ‘Inhuman’: CM A Revanth Reddy slams Allu Arjun In response, Allu Arjun refuted the accusations, describing them as ""character assassination."" At a press conference on December 21, the actor termed the incident a ""pure accident"" and expressed his condolences to the victim’s family. “I am taking hourly updates on the child’s condition, and it is improving, which is very good,” he said.Rejecting claims of organising a roadshow or procession, the actor said, “There is a lot of misinformation and false allegations. I don’t want to blame any department or politician. My character is being assassinated.”Also read: 'Character assassination': Actor Allu Arjun on stampede row after CM Revanth Reddy's criticism Following the stampede, the police registered a case against Allu Arjun, his security team, and the theatre management after a complaint from the deceased woman’s family.

"'They are vote bank': BJP accuses AAP of aiding Rohingya, Bangladeshi immigrants in Delhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/they-are-vote-bank-bjp-accuses-aap-of-aiding-rohingya-bangladeshi-immigrants-in-delhi/articleshow/116645407.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party accused the ruling Aam Aadmi Party of aiding illegal Rohingyas and Bangladeshis in Delhi by providing them with official documents, allegedly to use them as a vote bank.Former BJP Member of Parliament Parvesh Verma on Tuesday told PTI, ""We all know they do not vote for the BJP... they are AAP's vote bank."" Verma further alleged that once these illegal immigrants set up makeshift tenements (jhuggis) in the city, AAP leaders extended assistance to help them settle, making them eligible to vote in the elections.""“There is no immediate reaction from AAP regarding the BJP’s claims,” said a party spokesperson.The BJP’s attack on AAP intensified after the party claimed that these illegal immigrants were being settled in the city with help from AAP leaders, who allegedly issued them documents like ration cards to facilitate their voting in elections.Verma, who is preparing to contest the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls from the New Delhi seat, claimed to have identified areas in his constituency with a high concentration of such individuals.He also filed a complaint with the district magistrate requesting action on the issue.AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, who is the sitting Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) from New Delhi, took to X, alleging without naming anyone, ""They have started buying votes in my constituency. Openly giving Rs 1,000 cash per vote.""Additionally, Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva also charged that ever since the BJP demanded an investigation into the issue of illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya voters in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal had become flustered.He claimed these ""illegal infiltrators were perhaps the foundation of AAP's victory in Delhi elections.""In a related development, a BJP delegation recently met Election Commission officials, alleging that illegal Rohingya and Bangladeshis had been registered as voters in Delhi at AAP's behest. Meanwhile, Delhi Police arrested 11 individuals on Tuesday, claiming they had uncovered a gang involved in the illegal immigration of Bangladeshi nationals.Four of those arrested were Bangladeshi citizens, and the rest were allegedly involved in forging documents, an official confirmed.Earlier this month, Aam Aadmi Party accused the BJP of settling Rohingya refugees in the city while publicly vilifying them.In a statement, senior AAP leaders, including chief minister Atishi, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, pointed to a 2022 post on X by Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri as evidence of the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) involvement in housing Rohingya Muslims in EWS (Economically Weaker Section) flats in Delhi's Bakkarwala area.Also read: AAP accuses BJP of settling Rohingyas in Delhi; 'baseless rhetoric', says saffron party (With inputs from PTI)","BJP accuses Aam Aadmi Party of aiding illegal Rohingyas and Bangladeshis in Delhi by providing them with official documents.

NEW DELHI: Delhi airport on Wednesday issued an advisory alerting passengers about potential disruptions to flights that are not CAT III compliant due to low-visibility conditions. Travellers are advised to contact their respective airlines for updated flight information.A thin layer of fog blanketed parts of Delhi this morning, with the minimum temperature recorded at 9°C. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted the possibility of dense fog in the coming hours, further impacting visibility.While Delhi airport is equipped with a CAT III-enabled runway, capable of facilitating safe landings under low-visibility conditions, flights without CAT III compliance may face delays or cancellations.Delhi experienced a sudden shift in weather as light rain swept through several parts of the city on Christmas Eve, bringing a festive chill. The showers, which took place on Tuesday, provided temporary relief from the persistent pollution issues plaguing the national capital.The rainfall helped settle dust and pollutants, resulting in a marginal improvement in air quality. Despite this, the city's Air Quality Index (AQI) on Tuesday night remained at 356, categorised as ""very poor.""CAT III, or Category III, is a precision approach system that enables aircraft to land safely during severe fog or poor visibility, ensuring operational continuity for compliant flights, according to ANI.The authority has urged passengers to stay updated on flight schedules and plan their travel accordingly.","A thin layer of fog blanketed parts of Delhi this morning, with the minimum temperature recorded at 9°C.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee: A statesman who shaped India with his vision & resolve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-statesman-who-shaped-india-with-his-vision-resolve/articleshow/116645104.cms,"Today is a very special day for all of us. Our nation marks the 100th jayanti of our beloved former PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He stands tall as a statesman who continues to inspire countless people.Our nation will always be grateful to Atalji for being the architect of India's transition into the 21st century. When he took oath as PM in 1998, we had passed through a period of political instability. In about nine years, we had seen four Lok Sabha elections. People of India were getting impatient and sceptical about govts being able to deliver. It was Atalji who turned this tide by providing stable and effective governance. Coming from humble roots, he realised the struggles of the common citizen and the transformative power of effective governance.One can see the long-term impact of Atalji's leadership in so many sectors. His era marked a gigantic leap in the world of infotech, telecom and communications. This was particularly important for a nation like ours, which is also blessed with a very dynamic Yuva Shakti. NDA govt under Atalji made the first serious attempt to make technology accessible to common citizens. At the same time, there was foresight in connecting India. Even today, most people recall Golden Quadrilateral Project, which connected the length and breadth of India.Equally notable were Vajpayee govt's efforts to enhance local connectivity through initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Similarly, his govt gave a push to metro connectivity by doing extensive work for Delhi Metro, which stands out as a world-class infrastructure project. Vajpayee govt not only boosted economic growth but brought distant regions closer, fostering unity and integration.In the social sector, an initiative like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan highlights how Atalji dreamt of building an India where modern education is accessible to people across the nation, particularly for the poor and marginalised. At the same time, his govt presided over many reforms that set the stage for India's economic surge after several decades of following a philosophy that encouraged cronyism and stagnation.A wonderful example of his leadership can be seen in the summer of 1998. His govt had just assumed office and on May 11, India conducted the Pokhran tests, known as Operation Shakti. The world was stunned and expressed its anger in no uncertain terms. Any ordinary leader would have buckled, but Atalji was made differently.India stood firm and resolute with the govt calling for another set of tests two days later, on May 13! If the tests of May 11 showed scientific skill, those on May 13 showed true leadership. It was a message to the world that gone were the days when India would buckle under threats or pressure. Despite facing international sanctions, the then NDA govt stood firm, articulating India's right to safeguard its sovereignty while simultaneously being the strongest proponent of world peace.Atalji understood Indian democracy and the need to make it stronger. He presided over the creation of NDA, which redefined coalitions in Indian politics. He brought people together and made NDA a force for development, national progress and regional ambitions. His parliamentary brilliance was seen throughout his political journey. He belonged to a party with a handful of MPs, but his words were enough to rattle the might of the all-powerful Congress party that time. As PM, he blunted the criticisms of the Opposition with style and substance. His was a career spent largely on Opposition benches, but he never carried any trace of bitterness against anyone, even though the Congress stooped to new lows by calling him a traitor!He was also not one to cling to power through opportunistic means. He preferred to resign in 1996 instead of following the path of horse-trading and dirty politics. In 1999, his govt was defeated by 1 vote. A lot of people told him to challenge the immoral politics happening then but he preferred to go by the rules. Eventually, he came back with another resounding mandate from the people.When it comes to commitment to protecting our Constitution too, Atalji stands tall. He was deeply impacted by the martyrdom of Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Years later, he was a pillar of the anti-Emergency movement. In the run-up to the 1977 elections, he agreed to merger of his own party ( Jan Sangh ) into the Janata Party. I am sure it would have been a painful decision for him and the others, but safeguarding the Constitution was all that mattered to him.It is also noteworthy how deeply rooted Atalji was in Indian culture. Upon becoming India's external affairs minister, he became the first to speak in Hindi at the UN. This showcased his immense pride in India's heritage and identity, leaving an indelible mark on the global stage.Atalji's persona was magnetic and his life was enriched by his love for literature and expression. A prolific writer and poet, he used words to inspire, provoke thought, and offer solace. His poetry, often reflective of his inner struggles and hopes for the nation, continues to resonate with people across age groups.For so many BJP karyakartas like me, it is our privilege that we were able to learn and interact with a person like Atalji. His contribution to BJP was foundational. To spearhead an alternative narrative to a dominant Congress showed his greatness. Alongside stalwarts like L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi , he nurtured the party from its formative years, guiding it through challenges, setbacks and triumphs. Whenever the choice came between ideology and power, he always chose the former. He was able to convince the nation that an alternative world view from Congress was possible and such a world view could deliver.On his 100th jayanti, let us rededicate ourselves to realising his ideals and fulfilling his vision for India. Let us strive to build an India that embodies his principles of good governance, unity, and progress. Atalji's unwavering belief in the potential of our nation continues to inspire us to aim higher and work harder.","Today is the 100th jayanti of our beloved former PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Though ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafiqul Alam acknowledged that the extradition treaty between Bangladesh and India does not specify a time-frame for responses, he said Dhaka is ready to take the next step if India does not respond within a ""reasonable"" time period.Meanwhile, on India's strong protest over key interim govt aide Mahfuz Alam remarks, in which he had said India should recognise the uprising that forced Hasina to resign, the Bangladesh chief adviser's deputy press secretary Apurba Jahangir said that the Facebook post by Mahfuz was entirely his personal opinion. In another post, which was later deleted, Mahfuz had claimed that certain Indian territories should be part of Bangladesh. ""He later posted a clarification,"" Apurba said, asserting that the comments did not reflect the govt's position.","Bangladesh is awaiting a response from India regarding its request for the extradition of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina.

What do you think of the political battle between NDA and INDIA bloc over Ambedkar's legacy?

What is the status of UCC?

Any update of action against illegal activities and land laws?

Local body elections are scheduled for Jan 2025...

How significant is the winter Char Dham Yatra for the state's tourism?

Uttarakhand is set to implement UCC in Jan, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami tells TOI while stating that stringent measures were being taken against illegal activities, including unauthorised madrasas and land law violations. Excerpts:Congress party is spreading misinformation and disrespecting B R Ambedkar's legacy. Congress has a history of sidelining Ambedkar, but BJP has honoured him by establishing memorials in key locations associated with him.Congress's allegations are an attempt to create confusion and divert the people's attention from BJP's focus on development and equality. Whether it's the 1952 or 1954 elections, Congress and Nehru always conspired to keep him out of Parliament. They made every effort to stop him. For a long time, they didn't give him the recognition he deserved, but the people will see through it.The state is ready to implement Uniform Civil Code in Jan. Training is ongoing, and the draft has been reviewed and approved by the President. The rules and regulations are in place. A (mobile) app is under development to facilitate registrations and other services, enhancing accessibility for residents.On illegal activities, including unauthorised madrasas and land law violations, strict measures are being implemented. Also, it is important to maintain law and order alongside addressing ecological concerns. Changes to land laws are under way and will be introduced in the next session.BJP continues to enjoy the support of people in Uttarakhand due to the state and Centre focusing on development and nationalism. The 'one nation, one election' decision is revolutionary. It will save resources, manpower and time, as frequent elections disrupt development work. This will be a milestone for the country.We've started a new winter pilgrimage. It started on Dec 8 from Omkareshwar temple, and is getting good response. Even in winter, significant number of devotees are visiting shrines. The arrangements ensure visitors face no inconvenience. This initiative aims to promote year-round pilgrimage tourism, showcasing Uttarakhand's scenic beauty.","Uttarakhand is set to implement UCC in Jan, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami tells TOI while stating that stringent measures were being taken against illegal activities.

Police termed the money lost as a huge amount, when compared to other such frauds.Vikram received a call from the mobile number 8791120931 on Nov 11 at around 10.30am. The caller introduced himself as an officer from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and told Vikram that a sim card procured in his name was used for illegal advertisements and harassment messages. The fraudster informed him that his Aadhaar was used to procure it. He said they have initiated the process of blocking the sim and a case was registered at the Colaba cyber police station in Mumbai.Later, another miscreant contacted him from mobile number 7420928275, claiming to be a police officer. He told Vikram that his Aadhar was used to open bank accounts for money laundering.

They threatened to arrest him physically if he did not cooperate with the virtual investigation.Vikram then received a call from another number, 9997342801. The fraudsters made him download the Skype app. Subsequently, a person in police uniform made a video call, claiming to be from the Mumbai police.

Claims of discrimination

Online reactions

NEW DELHI: A video featuring a woman claiming that ""Bengaluru is Bengaluru because of North Indians"" has gone viral on social media, igniting discussions about regional contributions and perceptions in India's Silicon Valley.The clip, shared on X (formerly Twitter ) by a user identified as Woke Eminent, has garnered over 692,500 views and nearly 4,500 likes.In the video, the woman, originally from North India, responded to a question about the cultural shocks she experienced after moving to Bengaluru. She alleged that North Indians often face discrimination in the city and are addressed as ""these Hindi people.""""I don't know about cultural shock here. But people here do hate North Indians. That's what I have observed,"" she said. ""Autowalas charge us higher prices, and people call us 'these Hindi people.' We've been addressed as Hindi people many times.""Despite these experiences, the woman expressed her admiration for Bengaluru, saying, ""I love this city, absolutely, and would want to visit again. But the fact that when they see outsiders, they behave differently with you, especially when Bengaluru is what it is because of North Indians coming here to a large extent and still, people have a hard time accepting it.""The video sparked mixed reactions online. Some users supported the woman's perspective, emphasising the significant contribution of North Indians to Bengaluru’s IT industry. Others argued that the city's success stems from the opportunities it provides, regardless of regional origins.One user commented, “Most of the engineers in the firms located in Bengaluru are from northern states.” Meanwhile, others countered by saying, “Bengaluru provided the platform and infrastructure for these opportunities. Respect the city’s identity.”","A video featuring a woman claiming that ""Bengaluru is Bengaluru because of North Indians"" has gone viral on social media.

GST Council's popcorn taxation sparks backlash on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-gst-rates-on-popcorn-spark-backlash-on-social-media/articleshow/116601956.cms,"NEW DELHI: The GST Council's proposal to levy different tax rates on popcorn based on whether it contains sugar or salt has faced extensive backlash on social media, with two former government economic advisers criticising the taxation framework established in 2017.The GST Council, led by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Saturday proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.The Union finance minister defended the 18% tax on caramel popcorn, stating that items containing added sugar attracts different taxation.Later, the GST Council issued a clarification, saying that pre-packed and labelled ready-to-eat snacks will attract a 12 per cent tax while an 18 per cent GST will be levied if it is caramelised. There is no change in the tax rate of popcorn and the GST Council has only agreed that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will issue a circular clarifying the current taxation regime of popcorn.However, opposition politicians, economists and government supporters expressed their disapproval while others responded with humour and satire.""Complexity is a bureaucrat's delight and citizens' nightmare,"" said former Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian on X, questioning the decision's value given its minimal revenue impact and public inconvenience.Additionally, his predecessor Arvind Subramanian, criticised the move for increasing complexity rather than simplifying the system, mentioning issues with enforcement and rationality.Meanwhile, Congress party leader and spokesman Jairam Ramesh criticised the ""absurdity of three different tax slabs for popcorn under GST"", saying how it exemplifies the increasing complexity of what was intended to be a straightforward tax system.","GST Council proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.

Weight loss drug gets US nod to treat sleep apnea; India launch likely next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/weight-loss-drug-gets-us-nod-to-treat-sleep-apnea-india-launch-likely-next-year/articleshow/116641374.cms,"NEW DELHI: In good news for those suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition characterised by disordered breathing during sleep, the US FDA has, for the first time, approved an anti-diabetic drug also used for weight loss, sold under the brand name Zepbound (Tirzepatide), to manage the condition in adults with obesity.Treatments currently for moderate to severe OSA involve using assistive breathing devices such as CPAP and Bi-Pap. Zepbound makers Eli Lilly said they would launch the injectable drug under the brand name Mounjaro in India by 2025 after obtaining all approvals. Pricing is yet to be finalised. ""Our pricing strategy in India will reflect the medicine's efficacy and the significant value it brings in reducing the overall health and economic burden of type 2 diabetes and obesity,"" Eli Lilly said. Approximately, 104 million Indians have OSA, and 47 million have moderate or severe OSA, according to a study published in Sleep Medicine Reviews.""One of the treatments for OSA is weight reduction. This drug helps in reducing weight and, therefore, helps improve breathing during sleep. So, it can certainly prove to be a game-changer. But we need to wait for long-term results, potential side-effects and its applicability in a range for OSA patients,"" said a senior doctor. OSA occurs when a person's upper airway becomes blocked, causing pauses in breathing during sleep. Zepbound's approval for moderate to severe OSA in obese adults was based on two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 469 adults without type 2 diabetes.","The US FDA has approved an anti-diabetic drug also used for weight loss.

Just look at the six links they have given. You'll be shocked. Chandra Shekhar ji once said, 'Never use a vegetable-cutting knife for bypass surgery'. The notice wasn't even a vegetable-cutting knife; it was rusted.

But what surprised me more was that none of you read it. If you had, you wouldn't have been able to sleep for days.""He added that any constitutional position has to be vindicated by commitment to sublimity, sterling qualities and constitutionalism.""We are not in a position to settle scores. Because for the success of democracy, two things are inalienable: expression and dialogue,"" he said.The vice president warned about coordinated attempts to damage national interests, suggesting these efforts were systematically organised by groups opposed to the country's welfare.""Their objective is to destroy, brick by brick, our constitutional institutions, slur the presidency, and mind you, who is the president? The first tribal woman to become president of this country,"" he remarked.Discussing parliamentary proceedings, Dhankhar noted that both Houses were receiving negative attention.""Accountability must be enforced by media, the only conveyance to the people at large.

Isro to launch SpaDex mission on Dec 30 for developing space docking tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-to-launch-spadex-mission-on-dec-30-for-developing-space-docking-tech/articleshow/116641609.cms,"NEW DELHI: To take the first giant step towards launching India’s own space station and interplanetary missions, Isro is scheduled to launch the SpaDeX mission, which is aimed at developing and demonstrating a cost-effective technology required to dock and undock spacecraft in space, from Sriharikota at 9.58 pm on Dec 30 using its PSLV-C60 rocket.Through this mission, India is marching towards becoming the fourth country in the world to have space docking technology, Isro said. In a post on X, the space agency said, “PSLV-C60, fully integrated up to PS4 at the PIF facility for the first time, was moved to the MST at the First Launch Pad—over three hours captured in just a few seconds.”SpaDeX technology is essential for India's space ambitions such as landing an Indian on the Moon, sample return from the Moon, and building and operation of Bharatiya Antariksh Station, Isro said in an explainer.In-space docking technology is essential when multiple rocket launches are required to achieve common mission objectives. The SpaDeX mission was floated to develop and demonstrate the technology needed for rendezvous, docking and undocking of two small spacecraft in a low-Earth circular orbit, it said.The SpaDeX mission consists of two small spacecraft Target and Chaser (about 220 kg each) to be launched by PSLV-C60, independently and simultaneously, into a 470 km circular orbit at 55° inclination. The demonstrated precision of PSLV will be used to give a small relative velocity between Target and Chaser spacecraft at the time of separation from the launch vehicle. This incremental velocity will allow the Target spacecraft to build a 10-20 km inter-satellite separation with respect to Chaser within a day.At the end of this drift arrest manoeuvre, Target and Chaser will be in the same orbit with identical velocity, but separated by 20 km, known as Far Rendezvous. Chaser will then approach Target with progressively reduced inter-satellite distances of 5 km, 1.5 km, 500 m, 225 m, 15 m, and 3 m, ultimately leading to the docking of the two spacecraft.After successful docking and rigidisation, electrical power transfer between the two satellites will be demonstrated before undocking and separation of the satellites to start the operation of their respective payloads for the expected mission life of up to two years.Besides the docking demonstration, PSLV-C60 rocket’s fourth stage (POEM) will carry a total of 24 payloads that will be activated once two spacecraft are released in space. Of the 24, 14 payloads are from Isro centres and 10 payloads are from various non-government entities (NGEs) comprising academia and start-ups.","SpaDeX is aimed at developing and demonstrating a cost-effective technology required to dock and undock spacecraft in space.

Revenge? Bishnoi gang claims surface over a killing in California,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/revenge-bishnoi-gang-claims-surface-over-a-killing-in-california/articleshow/116642375.cms,"Gangster gunned down in California had

ops in Dubai, US

NEW DELHI: In the winter of 2022, a drug lord named Sunil Yadav landed in Delhi. He had cops and gangsters from Punjab chasing him. The crime syndicate wanted him as he was accused of snitching on Ankit Bhadu, an aide of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. Bhadu was killed by Punjab police in 2019. In Delhi, Yadav aka Goli was able to get a passport issued in the name of 'Rahul' and fly to Dubai, from where he embarked on a perilous ""Donkey route"" journey to the US, reports .Two days ago, Yadav was gunned down by assailants who barged into his house in Stockton, California. Early Tuesday, the Bishnoi group claimed responsibility - with US-based gangster Goldy Brar and Rohit Godara announcing it on social media - ending a five-year-long pursuit.The Facebook post read: ""To all brothers, I, Rohit Godara, and Goldy Brar, take full responsibility for the murder of Sunil Yadav, alias Goli, in California. He had colluded with Punjab police to orchestrate the encounter of our beloved brother, Ankit Bhadu. We have avenged his death.""The post also mentioned the house number (6,706) where Yadav was killed. The post further alleged that Sunil Yadav was involved in drug trade, supplying narcotics in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan, and had ties with the police. It also claimed that he had fled to the US after his role in Ankit Bhadu's encounter was exposed.The post concluded with a warning: ""To all our enemies, be prepared. We will reach you, no matter where you are in the world."" Investigators confirmed that Yadav's involvement in international-level drug trafficking operations spanned across Dubai and the US.""He was from Abohar, in Punjab's Fazilka district. He had managed to evade authorities by fleeing to the US two years ago using a fake passport,"" said a senior police officer.Interestingly, another associate, Rohit Godara, had also obtained a fake passport around the same time in the name of Pawan. The Rajasthan Police had issued a red corner notice against Yadav, soon after and a few of his associates were arrested in Dubai through local agencies.After Yadav's killing, the Stockton police said in a statement: ""Homicide (0349) at 6700 block of Mount Elbrus Way, Bear Creek District... Officers responded to the area of the call location on a report of a person shot. On arrival, officers located an adult male suffering from gunshot wounds. The victim was declared deceased, and detectives responded.""Ankit Bhadu, whose death had been haunting the Bishnoi group, was a prominent name in Punjab's underworld. Following Bishnoi's arrest, Bhadu seized control of the gang's operations. Both Bishnoi and Ankit, along with Yadav, came from the same place - Fazilka in Punjab. Ankit was born into an agricultural family and had abandoned his education midway. In the aftermath of Lawrence's incarceration, Bhadu's notoriety soared in Punjab and Rajasthan, with his name becoming synonymous with numerous cases of extortion, murder and coercion. Prominent businessmen lived in fear of his ransom demands and life threats.Bhadu's criminal tentacles extended far beyond Punjab and Rajasthan, with police in Haryana, Delhi, UP and Himachal Pradesh also seeking his capture. The Rajasthan and Haryana police had announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh each for information leading to his arrest, while Punjab police had offered a more substantial reward of Rs 2 lakh.In Aug 2018, Bhadu had a narrow escape from a police cordon laid by cops from Sriganganagar and Haryana. In the spring of 2019, the Punjab police's special intelligence cell finally tracked down and killed Bhadu, aged 23, in an encounter near Zirakpur. Interestingly, police had nabbed his girlfriend from Delhi airport a few days before the encounter.

Another potential route involved taking the Raimangal River to Hemnagar in Hingalganj, or reaching Khulna via Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas district,” a senior STF officer said, as quoted by PTI.Munshi was arrested by the West Bengal Special Task Force (STF) in a joint operation with the Jammu and Kashmir Police. The arrest took place near Canning in South 24 Parganas district, approximately 60 km from Kolkata, late Saturday night.The suspect was acting under the instructions of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group, according to the STF. The 58-year-old, described as an IED expert with extensive training in Pakistan, had been residing in the area disguised as a shawl seller for two days before he was arrested.“This individual appears to have been deeply involved in jihadist activities and was likely attempting to recruit people in the area,” the officer added. The STF is currently analyzing the call records from the mobile phones to identify potential collaborators and uncover more details about Munshi’s plans and movements.According to officials, Munshi’s notes, which are now being decoded, could provide valuable insights into his network and future plans.“Bangladesh was a strategic choice for Munshi as it could serve as a transit point to Pakistan. His journey from Kashmir to Bengal was part of a carefully calculated escape strategy,” the officer elaborated.Investigators disclosed that Munshi was the second-in-command of the TuM and had ties to other terror outfits operating in the Kashmir Valley, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Seized during the arrest were an Aadhaar card listing a Srinagar address, Rs 50,000 in cash, and two mobile phones. Officials believe Munshi had visited Bangladesh several times in the past and maintained close contact with senior LeT members.",Javed Munshi was wanted for his alleged involvement in a 2011 cleric's murder in Jammu and Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Former Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das has stepped down as Odisha governor as part of a gubernatorial reshuffle that saw Mizoram's Hari Babu Kambhampati replace him, and Arif Mohammad Khan move from Kerala to Bihar, swapping places with Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar.A Rashtrapati Bhavan communique said Das, who was appointed governor in Oct 2023, had resigned. The surprise development came against the backdrop of a huge controversy over his son assaulting a Raj Bhavan staffer for not sending a luxury car to pick him up from Puri railway junction. Opposition had stalled assembly proceedings, demanding action.Although Raghubar Das managed to put a lid on it by making his son offer an apology to the aggrieved employee who, in turn, withdrew the police complaint lodged by his wife, the ex-Jharkhand CM found himself embroiled in another controversy when he parked himself in his hometown Jamshedpur to successfully campaign for election of his daughter-in-law Purnima Das in the recent polls. There was also speculation about Das wanting to return to active electoral politics during the run-up to assembly polls.Appointment of V K Singh, who served as a minister of state during the first two Modi govts, as Mizoram governor is seen as his rehabilitation. His new assignment will see the ex-Army chief, who led operations to evacuate stranded Indians from Yemen and Sudan and was involved in successful rescue of workers trapped in Silkyara tunnel in Uttarakhand in 2023, returning to a region he had served in while in uniform.Former Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla's appointment as Manipur governor appears to have been influenced by the need to restore stability to the trouble-torn state. Having served as Union home secretary for five years, he is familiar with the challenge awaiting him ahead of elections in the state.","Former Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das steps down as Odisha governor.

K Annamalai: ‘If he believes he’s a bigger star…’: Annamalai slams Telangana CM Revanth Reddy over Allu Arjun case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-he-believes-hes-a-bigger-star-annamalai-slams-telangana-cm-revanth-reddy-over-allu-arjun-case/articleshow/116631007.cms,"File photo: BJP Tamil Nadu President K Annamalai (Picture credit: X/@annamalai_k)

NEW DELHI: BJP Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai launched a scathing attack on Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy for police action against Telugu actor Allu Arjun in the stampede incident and said that it is a clear case of victimisation and bullying, orchestrated by Telangana CM.He criticised the CM’s handling of the situation, accusing him of leveraging state powers for personal and political vendettas. He also claimed that the vandalisation at the actor's residence was done by people from the CM's constituency.Addressing reporters, Annamalai said that Reddy was attempting to outshine Telugu superstar Allu Arjun.“I saw Mr Revanth Reddy’s interview, and it feels like he’s trying to compete with Allu Arjun for the title of superstar. If he believes he’s a bigger star, he should make a movie and see if he can pull crowds like Allu Arjun,” Annamalai remarked.The Tamil Nadu BJP leader also rebuked the Telangana government’s handling of the case, alleging bias and political motivations . “The way chief minister Revanth Reddy has spoken about Allu Arjun reeks of hatred rather than neutrality. Instead of focusing on governance, it appears that he is engaging in a competition to outshine the superstar,” he said.Annamalai questioned the treatment being given to the actor and said that the stampede during 'Pushpa 2' screening was an accident which was not intentionally planned by the actor. “Did Allu Arjun have the intention or motive for someone to lose their life? The incident was an accident, and he has shown remorse, but this relentless targeting is unwarranted,” he added.The comments come as Allu Arjun faces legal scrutiny over the December 4 stampede at Sandhya Theatre in Hyderabad, where a woman named Revathi lost her life and her son was critically injured. Despite claims of cooperation with the investigation, the actor has been accused of negligence and violating public safety norms by organizing a roadshow without official permission.Annamalai suggested that the Congress’s actions, including protests at Allu Arjun’s residence, were politically motivated. “The people throwing stones and creating chaos are politically aligned. It’s clear that Congress is using this incident as a stage to settle scores with someone who has refused to toe their line,” he stated.“State powers are meant to serve the people, not to play politics. This entire episode shows Congress’s inability to focus on governance,” Annamalai added.Annamalai emphasised the need for impartiality and adherence to the rule of law. “Cinema stars, despite their fame, must be treated equally under the law. However, this case reflects a clear misuse of power for political gains. Bullying and victimising an individual, especially someone who has expressed regret and cooperated fully, serve no justice,” he stated.Earlier, BJP leaders such as Pradeep Bhandari and Shehzad Poonawalla alleged that Congress orchestrated the vandalism at Allu Arjun’s Jubilee Hills residence. “This is vendetta politics . The Congress, unable to tolerate a neutral voice like Arjun’s, is resorting to state-sponsored attacks,” Poonawalla said, pointing to the involvement of individuals linked to the Kodangal Youth Congress in the protests.Bhandari alleged that the protestors were close associates of CM Revanth Reddy, accusing the Congress of “vendetta politics.”While Telangana CM Revanth Reddy has held the actor responsible for the tragedy, alleging violations of public safety, BJP leaders have rallied around Arjun, accusing Congress of authoritarian tactics.","BJP Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai launched a scathing attack on Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy for police action against Telugu actor Allu Arjun in the stampede incident.

The Congress consistently worked to keep him out of Parliament and to silence the voice of Dalits and marginalised communities,"" the UP chief minister claimed.Yogi Adityanath highlighted Congress's ""apathy"" as he accused the party of working to defeat Ambedkar in elections, including the 1952 general elections from Mumbai North and the 1954 byelections.""During the UPA regime, the Congress displayed its malice when a textbook portrayed a derogatory cartoon of Ambedkar being prodded by Pt Nehru. It was only after widespread protests that the book was withdrawn and the then HRD minister, Kapil Sibal, had to apologise,"" Adityanath stated.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadanvis also hit out at the Congress for ""acting out of frustration"" and asked the party to apologise for ""wasting the time of Parliament and now wasting the people's time"".""Congress is acting out of frustration because it has been revealed how its leaders, from Nehru ji to Rahul Gandhi, have consistently insulted the Constitution and denied reservation.
